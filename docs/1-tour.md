As the airport doors slide open, a wall of heat engulfs me. The bus veers right, so I step on from the left. A1 to Mo Chit, BTS to my destination.

My hostel room is a cramped cell, and outside its window, Bangkok comes alive at night. Tuk-tuks blast music, drunk laughter and arguments fill the air. Sleep comes in fits and starts, interrupted by the chaos beyond.

I check my watch: midnight. But this city never sleeps. Its energy pulsates like a living organism.

This is it. Bangkok, good-time city. Gateway to Southeast Asia. Where dollars and Duetsmarks get turned into counterfeit watches and genuine scars.

### PRATUNAM

Early the next morning, I moved to a hotel near Pratunam. The hotel was located on a busy street with a market below. There were crowds of people constantly walking by, and the road was filled with vendors selling their wares. You had to navigate through the crowds and gaps in between to get around.

The horn honking of cars, the whistles sounding for traffic direction, the chirping of doves, the humming of air conditioning and refrigerators, the shutting doors in other rooms, and the elevator's beep all filled the silence in the room with noise.

"What do you want? Take a ride? Spots? You want silk? I'll take you to the best silk place? Diamonds? Come with me, get presents for girlfriend. Maybe no girlfriend. You want a girl, no problem. Good time. Boy girl fucking no problem..." When you walk on the street, there are always people of different colors trying to talk to you.

### COWBOY

In the evening, I went to Cowboy Street, a short red-light district. I found a seat and ordered a bottle of beer. Across from me, a Caucasian man sat and greeted me. We started chatting, and to my surprise, he worked in Chongqing. He departed as soon as his 'Thai wife' showed up.

<a-map driving="13.813143,100.548074,Mo Chit Bus Station|17.014624,99.812901,Sukhothai Bus Terminal"></a-map>

The bus only stopped in the new town, so I walked directly to the songthaew after getting off. I asked the driver how much it would cost to go to the ancient city and haggled with him. He just said "okay". The driver took me to a convenience store in the ancient city, where I insisted on going to a hotel nearby. When we arrived, the driver said the place was far and there was no discount, and this made the whole trip unpleasant.

When I got off, I couldn't find the resort and only saw a small food cart selling skewers. I went to buy some and asked for directions. The owner of the cart called over a person in a police uniform who helped me find the way. Just as I was leaving, the police officer stopped me and insisted on driving me to the hotel. I was worried about being cheated, but I couldn't resist his enthusiasm and had to get on the pickup.

It drove about one one hundred meters forward, turned right for another one hundred meters, and then we arrived at the hotel. He didn't ask me for any money and just said he was a teacher nearby. It was then that I remembered seeing a car of boy scouts on the road.

<a-hotel name="Baan Rim Klong Resort" date="2013-10-12" nights="2" points="17.031670,99.706329"></a-hotel>

The owner of the guesthouse was a Thai couple, and their daughter received me at the front desk. She was beautiful and even introduced me to their golden retriever, Latu.

The guesthouse provided bicycles for 50 baht a day. I rode on one and started from the north of the ancient city, exploring my way to the center.

As the sun began to set, I found a restaurant outside the city walls to have dinner. By the time I finished, it was already dark. Unlike cities, there were few streetlights here, and the roads were hardly visible at night. I looked at the map and had two options: spend more time returning along the main road, or take an unknown shortcut. I chose the latter. The path was completely dark, and I had to rely on a weak light to find my way. I rode my bike like crazy on this pitch-black road. All kinds of flying insects hit my face, and some even flew into my mouth. Halfway through the trip, I finally saw the light of a motorcycle and quickly moved over to the side of the road. Not long after, I saw fireflies on the roadside. There were only two or three of them, but they were especially prominent in the dark.

When I returned to the guesthouse, they were amazed by my experience. They invited me to their room to play, and the couple, their daughter, and their cat Momo were there. We played poker together, and they even taught me how to count in Thai.

### MORNING

In the morning, I intended to cycle on a small road to the bus stop next to the 7-11 convenience store to book a ticket to Chiangmai. As I passed through a residential area, the residents along the road greeted me, and I smiled as I cycled through the whole road. Even a male resident came out of his yard, stopped me, shook my hand, and asked where I was from and where I was going.

<a-map walking="17.031670,99.706329,Baan Rim Klong Resort|17.032004,99.702915|17.0247242,99.7038567,North Gate|17.018468,99.710928,7-Eleven"></a-map>

On the night, the daughter knocked on my door and said there was a festival activity tonight, asking if I wanted to join them. I said I was too tired and didn't want to go. Now I regret.

### ON THE ROAD

<a-map driving="17.018732,99.712043,Wintour Bus Station|18.2772803,99.4807422,Lampang bus terminal|18.799716,99.017627,Chiang Mai Bus Terminal 3"></a-map>

I was sitting a few rows behind the bus, and there were several foreigners at the back. We briefly chatted. Sitting next to me was a Chinese man who claimed to be in the Burmese gem business. He actively asked me for my contact information, saying that I could reach out to him in Chiang Mai. However, I didn't want to do that.

The bus stopped at Lampang bus terminal for a short while, and I thought it was Chiang Mai, so I got off. After a while, I realized that it wasn't right, so I got back on the bus.

## CHIANG MAI ¹

<a-times :times="1" location="CHIANG MAI"></a-times>

On my first evening in Chiang Mai, I decided to go for a walk. With a little memory of the map, I walked along the Chiang Mai River past the embassy, flower and fruit markets, had a snack in a alley, and walked back to the hotel along the moat according to my sense of direction.

It became the only way I can forget loneliness.
I came here everynight to dream? No, I came to be woken up.
The dream had became my reality.

The night before I leave Chiangmai, I cried.
Say goodbye to my "first love" in the music of `Every Breath You Take`.

On my last day in Phuket, the winds picked up and it started raining heavily, accompanied by strong gusts of wind. This meant that the planes wouldn't be able to land on the beachside, and I wouldn't be able to get the photos I wanted.

However, I didn't have time. I had to brave the wind and rain and struggle towards the beach. I passed through the Sirinat National Park and arrived at the end of the road. From here, there was only sand to walk on. Soon, I encountered a "river" where the rainwater on the land converged into a stream, carving out a "road" on the sand. The current was strong, so I put away my camera and carefully waded across it. After walking for a while, I finally arrived at the end of the runway. As soon as I got there, an A380 took off from above my head.

From the ceiling above the bathtub in the bathroom, I heard a guy and a Thai girl engaging in noisy sex.
They were reaching the climax of their activity.

That's OK, they are on holiday.
Instead of recording it, I turned on the air conditioning and television. I really enjoyed a moment of "silence".
