Taking the A1 Bus, I arrived in there in early October 2013. On the first day, I suddenly found myself in an environment without Chinese. I felt like I had developed a loss of speech and couldn't even open my mouth. I stayed in a simple room that night. It was very noisy outside with the sound of tuk-tuks playing music, drunken people causing a racket, and doors slamming. I went to bed early, but when I woke up and looked at my watch, I found that it was still lively outside at 3 a.m. This is it. Bangkok, good-time city. Gateway to Southeast Asia. Where dollars and Duetsmarks get turned into counterfeit watches and genuine scars.

### South Korea

This is not my first time to go abroad. The year I became a sales champion, the prize was a trip. Due to the outbreak of the Red Shirt Movement in Thailand, I chose to go to South Korea. It was my first time abroad and my first time on a plane.

I joined a tour group. When the tour guide asked if everyone was willing to go to the spots on the 38th parallel at their own expense, a girl named Wenwen and I chose not to go. We were pitifully left at a rest stop on the way. We found a convenience store and went inside to buy coffee to drink. The owner's child was particularly cute, and he came up to play with us. We couldn't understand his words, and he couldn't understand our language, but it was also interesting. Language seemed to be no obstacle.

### PRATUNAM

The next day, I felt that I could communicate in some simple English. I also moved from Sukhumvit to Pratunam.

### COWBOY

I met a white guy there who said he working in Chongqing. He's a farang, and he's waiting for his Thai girlfriend.
We drinked till the thai girl come.

"Why are you taking a trip by yourself", he asked.
I was traveling alone for two reasons. First of all, being alone allows you more opportunity to absorb your experiences on a personal level. Secondly, and this I felt acutely at that moment, there was no one who wanted to go with me.

The bus only stopped in the new town, so I walked directly to the songthaew after getting off. I asked the driver how much it would cost to go to the ancient city and haggled with him. He just said "okay". The driver took me to a convenience store in the ancient city, where I insisted on going to a hotel nearby. When we arrived, the driver said the place was far and there was no discount, and this made the whole trip unpleasant.

When I got off, I couldn't find the resort and only saw a small food cart selling skewers. I went to buy some and asked for directions. The owner of the cart called over a person in a police uniform who helped me find the way. Just as I was leaving, the police officer stopped me and insisted on driving me to the hotel. I was worried about being cheated, but I couldn't resist his enthusiasm and had to get on the pickup.

It drove about one one hundred meters forward, turned right for another one hundred meters, and then we arrived at the hotel. He didn't ask me for any money and just said he was a teacher nearby. It was then that I remembered seeing a car of boy scouts on the road.

The owner of the guesthouse was a Thai couple, and their daughter received me at the front desk. She was beautiful and even introduced me to their golden retriever, Latu.

The guesthouse provided bicycles for 50 baht a day. I rode on one and started from the north of the ancient city, exploring my way to the center. As the sun began to set, I found a restaurant outside the city walls to have dinner. By the time I finished, it was already dark. Unlike cities, there were few streetlights here, and the roads were hardly visible at night. I looked at the map and had two options: spend more time returning along the main road, or take an unknown shortcut. I chose the latter. The path was completely dark, and I had to rely on a weak light to find my way. I rode my bike like crazy on this pitch-black road. All kinds of flying insects hit my face, and some even flew into my mouth. Halfway through the trip, I finally saw the light of a motorcycle and quickly moved over to the side of the road. Not long after, I saw fireflies on the roadside. There were only two or three of them, but they were especially prominent in the dark.

When I returned to the guesthouse, they were amazed by my experience. They invited me to their room to play, and the couple, their daughter, and their cat Momo were there. We played poker together, and they even taught me how to count in Thai.

On the last night, the daughter knocked on my door and said there was a festival activity tonight, asking if I wanted to join them. I said I was too tired and didn't want to go. Now looking back, I regret it a little bit

It became the only way I can forget loneliness.
I came here everynight to dream? No, I came to be woken up.
The dream had became my reality.

The night before I leave Chiangmai, I cried.
Say goodbye to my "first love" in the music of `Every Breath You Take`.

It's the last day I stay in Phuket, it heavy rained in the morning,
and the wind below to East which mean planes will not landing at beach side.
Even though, I plan to walking to airport, for photos of plane.

I hide under my umbrella, elude the strong wind.

Rain stopped, wind direction changed! When I reached the end of the road.

I leave the road and step on sand, heading airport along the beach.
And a flood stream stopped me, my camera will die if I fall into it.

Finally, I reached the end of the runway. An A380 took off over my head immediately. However, I continued to watch the flight radar app and waited for a landing. I tooked some photos of planes, including a beautiful B747. As the sky began to warm and shine, I felt proud of my perseverance and determination to get these photos desipte the challenging and circumstances.
