As the airport doors slide open, a wall of heat engulfs me. The bus veers right, so I step on from the left. A1 to Mo Chit, BTS to my destination.

My hostel room is a cramped cell, and outside its window, Bangkok comes alive at night. Tuk-tuks blast music, drunk laughter and arguments fill the air. Sleep comes in fits and starts, interrupted by the chaos beyond.

I check my watch: midnight. But this city never sleeps. Its energy pulsates like a living organism.

This is it. Bangkok, good-time city. Gateway to Southeast Asia. Where dollars and Duetsmarks get turned into counterfeit watches and genuine scars.

### PRATUNAM

Early the next morning, I moved to a hotel near Pratunam. The hotel was located on a busy street with a market below. There were crowds of people constantly walking by, and the road was filled with vendors selling their wares. You had to navigate through the crowds and gaps in between to get around.

The horn honking of cars, the whistles sounding for traffic direction, the chirping of doves, the humming of air conditioning and refrigerators, the shutting doors in other rooms, and the elevator's beep all filled the silence in the room with noise.

"What do you want? Take a ride? Spots? You want silk? I'll take you to the best silk place? Diamonds? Come with me, get presents for girlfriend. Maybe no girlfriend. You want a girl, no problem. Good time. Boy girl fucking no problem..." When you walk on the street, there are always people of different colors trying to talk to you.

### COWBOY

In the evening, I went to Cowboy Street, a short red-light district. I found a seat and ordered a bottle of beer. Across from me, a Caucasian man sat and greeted me. We started chatting, and to my surprise, he worked in Chongqing. He departed as soon as his 'Thai wife' showed up.

<a-map driving="100.548074,13.813143,Mo Chit Bus Station|99.812901,17.014624,Sukhothai Bus Terminal"></a-map>

The bus only stopped in the new town, so I walked directly to the songthaew after getting off. I asked the driver how much it would cost to go to the ancient city and haggled with him. He just said "okay". The driver took me to a convenience store in the ancient city, where I insisted on going to a hotel nearby. When we arrived, the driver said the place was far and there was no discount, and this made the whole trip unpleasant.

Disembarking, I found myself lost and unable to locate the resort, only spotting a humble food cart selling skewers. I approached and purchased some, using the opportunity to ask for directions. The owner of the cart promptly summoned a uniformed police officer who kindly offered to guide me.

As I prepared to depart, the officer insisted on personally driving me to the hotel in his pickup truck. My suspicions were initially raised, but his unwavering enthusiasm left me with no choice but to accept.

We drove a mere hundred meters forward before turning right for another hundred, and soon enough, we arrived at the hotel. To my surprise, he did not demand any payment, simply revealing that he was a teacher in the area. It was then that I recalled seeing a group of boy scouts traveling in a vehicle earlier - perhaps they were his students.

The proprietors of the guesthouse were an amiable Thai couple, and their captivating daughter greeted me at the reception desk. She was a vision of beauty, and she even introduced me to their golden retriever, Latu.

For a modest fee of 50 baht per day, the guesthouse provided bicycles for its patrons. I hopped on one and began my exploration from the northern edge of the ancient city, leisurely making my way towards its heart.

As the sun began to dip below the horizon, I sought out a restaurant just beyond the city's boundaries. By the time my meal was finished, darkness had descended upon the landscape. Unlike the bustling cities, this place was sparsely lit, and the roads were shrouded in shadows at night.

With the map in hand, I faced a choice: return along the well-lit main road or take an uncharted shortcut through the darkness. I chose the latter. The path ahead was pitch-black, forcing me to rely on a feeble light source to navigate. Gripping the handlebars tightly, I pedaled furiously down the winding road, with all manner of insects pelting my face and some even finding their way into my mouth.

Halfway through my journey, a glimmer of hope appeared as the headlight of a motorcycle emerged from the darkness. I quickly veered to the side of the road, and soon after, I noticed a few fireflies hovering near the roadside. Only two or three in number, they seemed like beacons of light in the inky blackness.

Upon my return to the guesthouse, the hosts were astonished by my account of the journey. They invited me to their room. The couple, their daughter, and their cat Momo was there. We laughed and played poker together, and they even taught me how to count in Thai.

### MORNING

In the morning, I intended to cycle on a small road to the bus stop next to the 7-11 convenience store to book a ticket to Chiangmai. As I passed through a residential area, the residents along the road greeted me, and I smiled as I cycled through the whole road. Even a male resident came out of his yard, stopped me, shook my hand, and asked where I was from and where I was going.

<a-map walking="99.706329,17.031670,Baan Rim Klong Resort|99.702915,17.032004|99.7038567,17.0247242,North Gate|99.709757,17.018625,Bus Stop"></a-map>

On the night, the daughter knocked on my door and said there was a festival activity tonight, asking if I wanted to join them. I said I was too tired and didn't want to go. Now I regret.

### ON THE ROAD

<a-map driving="99.709757,17.018625,Bus Stop|99.4807422,18.2772803,Lampang bus terminal|99.017627,18.799716,Chiang Mai Bus Terminal 3"></a-map>

I was sitting a few rows behind the bus, and there were several foreigners at the back. We briefly chatted. Sitting next to me was a Chinese man who claimed to be in the Burmese gem business. He actively asked me for my contact information, saying that I could reach out to him in Chiang Mai. However, I didn't want to do that.

The bus stopped at Lampang bus terminal for a short while, and I thought it was Chiang Mai, so I got off. After a while, I realized that it wasn't right, so I got back on the bus.

## CHIANG MAI

<a-times :times="1" location="CHIANG MAI"></a-times>

On my first evening in Chiang Mai, I decided to go for a walk. With a little memory of the map, I walked along the Chiang Mai River past the embassy, flower and fruit markets, had a snack in a alley, and walked back to the hotel along the moat according to my sense of direction.

Say goodbye to my "first love" in the music of `Every Breath You Take`.

On my last day in Phuket, the winds picked up and it started raining heavily, accompanied by strong gusts of wind. This meant that the planes wouldn't be able to land on the beachside, and I wouldn't be able to get the photos I wanted.

However, I didn't have time. I had to brave the wind and rain and struggle towards the beach. I passed through the Sirinat National Park and arrived at the end of the road. From here, there was only sand to walk on. Soon, I encountered a "river" where the rainwater on the land converged into a stream, carving out a "road" on the sand. The current was strong, so I put away my camera and carefully waded across it. After walking for a while, I finally arrived at the end of the runway. As soon as I got there, an A380 took off from above my head.

#### BAIYOKE SUITE HOTEL

I went back to the hotel where I had stayed.

<a-hotel name="Baiyoke Suite Hotel" date="2013-10-29" nights="2" points="100.5373002,13.7530194"></a-hotel>

From the ceiling above the bathtub in the bathroom, I heard a guy and a Thai girl engaging in noisy sex.
They were reaching the climax of their activity.

That's OK, they are on holiday.
Instead of recording it, I turned on the air conditioning and television. I really enjoyed a moment of "silence".
