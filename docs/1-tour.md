I had my visa and did not include a tip in my passport as suggested online; such practices should not be encouraged. The first customs check went smoothly, and I finally arrived in Bangkok. As the guide suggested, I found an ATM on the second floor and withdrew some Thai Baht. With that, I was all set to embark on my journey.

### DON MEANG

As the doors to the terminal slide open, a wall of heat envelops me. Navigating through the humid air, I make my way to the bus stop. The bus pulls up, turning to the right, and I board from the left side. Taking the A1 bus to Mo Chit, I then plan to take the BTS to reach my final destination.

### FIRST DAY

On my first day, I was overwhelmed by Foreign Language Anxiety and completely avoided speaking with anyone. It wasn't until the second day that this anxiety began to subside. The city had a somewhat dilapidated appearance, with many street vendors selling their goods from carts along the roadside. White-collar workers commuted to and from their jobs using 'motos', a type of local taxi service here where drivers in uniform operate motorcycles, allowing passengers to ride pillion.

My hostel room feels like a cramped cell, and beyond its window, Bangkok erupts into life at night. Tuk-tuks blare music, and the air buzzes with the sounds of drunk laughter and heated arguments. Sleep comes in fragmented bursts, constantly interrupted by the pandemonium outside.

I glance at my watch; it reads midnight. Yet, this city never rests. Its energy pulses as if it were a living organism.

This is it—Bangkok, good-time city. Gateway to Southeast Asia. Where dollars and Deutsche Mark get turned into counterfeit watches and genuine scars.

### PRATUNAM

The following morning, I relocated to a hotel situated near Pratunam. Nestled on a bustling street, the hotel overlooked a lively market teeming with activity. A steady stream of people flowed through the narrow lanes, weaving between vendors peddling their diverse goods. Maneuvering through this vibrant maze required patience and agility, as one had to navigate the crowds and find paths amidst the stalls. The dynamic atmosphere was both captivating and a bit overwhelming, encapsulating the energetic spirit of the area.

During the day, I find myself confined to the hotel, unsure of where to go.

The honking of car horns, the whistles directing traffic, the cooing of doves, the hum of air conditioners and refrigerators, doors slamming in other rooms, and the elevator's beep all contributed to filling the room with a cacophony of sounds.

Certain noises transport me back to similar sounds I once heard on Gulangyu Island, stirring up feelings of confusion and unease within me.

"What do you want? Take a ride? Spots? You want silk? I'll take you to the best silk place? Diamonds? Come with me, get presents for girlfriend. Maybe no girlfriend. You want a girl, no problem. Good time. Boy girl fucking no problem..." When walking down the street, it is common to encounter people from various backgrounds trying to engage with you.

### COWBOY

In the evening, I visited Cowboy Street, a small red-light district. Finding a seat, I ordered a bottle of beer. Across from me, a Caucasian man sat down and greeted me. We began chatting, and to my surprise, he worked in Chongqing. As soon as his 'Thai wife' arrived, he excused himself and left.

### CHINA TOWN

The next day, the journey to China Town wasn't without its challenges. Initially, I took the subway heading to Hua Lamphong but mistakenly ended up at the train station. In the end, with no better option, I opted for a motorcycle taxi. Being not particularly comfortable on motorcycles, I instinctively placed my hand on the driver’s shoulder when we turned corners. This seemed to bother the driver somewhat. Fortunately, the destination was not too far away, and we arrived swiftly.

Every day at the hotel, there would be a taxi driver waiting downstairs. Each time he saw me, he would smile and politely inquire where I was going, offering his services. Despite staying at the hotel for two days, I had never taken up his offer—until today. This morning, It was time for him to receive some reward for his persistent kindness. I took his tuk-tuk to Mo Chit Bus Station, from where I would continue my journey to the next destination: Sukhothai.

The bus only stopped in the new town, so I walked directly to the songthaew after getting off. I asked the driver how much it would cost to go to the ancient city and haggled with him. He just said "okay". The driver took me to a convenience store in the ancient city, where I insisted on going to a hotel nearby. When we arrived, the driver said the place was far and there was no discount, and this made the whole trip unpleasant.

Disembarking, I found myself lost and unable to locate the resort, only spotting a humble food cart selling skewers. I approached and purchased some, using the opportunity to ask for directions. The owner of the cart promptly summoned a uniformed police officer who kindly offered to guide me.

As I prepared to depart, the officer insisted on personally driving me to the hotel in his pickup truck. My suspicions were initially raised, but his unwavering enthusiasm left me with no choice but to accept.

We drove a mere hundred meters forward before turning right for another hundred, and soon enough, we arrived at the hotel. To my surprise, he did not demand any payment, simply revealing that he was a teacher in the area. It was then that I recalled seeing a group of boy scouts traveling in a vehicle earlier - perhaps they were his students.

The proprietors of the guesthouse were an amiable Thai couple, and their captivating daughter greeted me at the reception desk. She was a vision of beauty, and she even introduced me to their golden retriever, Latu.

For a modest fee of 50 baht per day, the guesthouse provided bicycles for its patrons. I hopped on one and began my exploration from the northern edge of the ancient city, leisurely making my way towards its heart.

As the sun began to dip below the horizon, I sought out a restaurant just beyond the city's boundaries. By the time my meal was finished, darkness had descended upon the landscape. Unlike the bustling cities, this place was sparsely lit, and the roads were shrouded in shadows at night.

With the map in hand, I faced a choice: return along the well-lit main road or take an uncharted shortcut through the darkness. I chose the latter. The path ahead was pitch-black, forcing me to rely on a feeble light source to navigate. Gripping the handlebars tightly, I pedaled furiously down the winding road, with all manner of insects pelting my face and some even finding their way into my mouth.

Halfway through my journey, a glimmer of hope appeared as the headlight of a motorcycle emerged from the darkness. I quickly veered to the side of the road, and soon after, I noticed a few fireflies hovering near the roadside. Only two or three in number, they seemed like beacons of light in the inky blackness.

Upon my return to the guesthouse, the hosts were astonished by my account of the journey. They invited me to their room. The couple, their daughter, and their cat Momo was there. We laughed and played poker together, and they even taught me how to count in Thai.

### MORNING

In the morning, I intended to cycle on a small road to the bus stop next to the 7-11 convenience store to book a ticket to Chiangmai. As I passed through a residential area, the residents along the road greeted me, and I smiled as I cycled through the whole road. Even a male resident came out of his yard, stopped me, shook my hand, and asked where I was from and where I was going.

On the night, the daughter knocked on my door and said there was a festival activity tonight, asking if I wanted to join them. I said I was too tired and didn't want to go. Now I regret.

### ON THE ROAD

<a-map driving="99.709757,17.018625,Bus Stop|99.4807422,18.2772803,Lampang bus terminal|99.017627,18.799716,Chiang Mai Bus Terminal 3"></a-map>

I was sitting a few rows behind the bus, and there were several foreigners at the back. We briefly chatted. Sitting next to me was a Chinese man who claimed to be in the Burmese gem business. He actively asked me for my contact information, saying that I could reach out to him in Chiang Mai. However, I didn't want to do that.

The bus stopped at Lampang bus terminal for a short while, and I thought it was Chiang Mai, so I got off. After a while, I realized that it wasn't right, so I got back on the bus.

On my last day in Phuket, the winds picked up and it started raining heavily, accompanied by strong gusts of wind. This meant that the planes wouldn't be able to land on the beachside, and I wouldn't be able to get the photos I wanted.

However, I didn't have time. I had to brave the wind and rain and struggle towards the beach. I passed through the Sirinat National Park and arrived at the end of the road. From here, there was only sand to walk on. Soon, I encountered a "river" where the rainwater on the land converged into a stream, carving out a "road" on the sand. The current was strong, so I put away my camera and carefully waded across it. After walking for a while, I finally arrived at the end of the runway. As soon as I got there, an A380 took off from above my head.

Later, the rain stopped, the wind direction changed, and even the sun came out.

### PRATUNAM

#### BAIYOKE SUITE HOTEL

I went back to the hotel where I had stayed.

<a-hotel name="Baiyoke Suite Hotel" date="2013-10-29" nights="2" points="100.53985634597014,13.752907383951737"></a-hotel>

From the ceiling above the bathtub in the bathroom, I heard a guy and a Thai girl engaging in noisy sex.
They were reaching the climax of their activity.

That's OK, they are on holiday.
Instead of recording it, I turned on the air conditioning and television. I really enjoyed a moment of "silence".
