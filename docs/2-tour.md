I nearly missed my international flight.

I had planned to take a domestic flight to Kunming first, and I thought I would have plenty of time to catch the airline to Kula Lumpur. When I arrived at the boarding gate, it was too early, but to my surprise, the plane was already there. It was scheduled to fly from Kunming to Chongqing and then to another destination. After completing those routes, it would turn and went directly to Chongqing and take me to Kunming. The plane was there due a delay of previous schedule. I had to wait for it to leave and come back.

 

Two hours later, around the same time I had  reserved, I finally arrived at Kunming. When I rushed out of cabin, the next flight was already boarding. I realized that I had to wait for my package and recheck in, even though there was no international transfer channel.  I was the last persih checked in at the counter, and I boarded at the last minute just before gate close.

Taking airport bus from LCCT, I reached KL Sentral at midnight. I was going to took the Monorail, but the station was already shutdown. Thus, I had to took a taxi.

I get off at the Times Square where my hostel located.

Everyone was obviously asleep because they were snoring loudly. I walked quietly and tried to not wake anyone up. My bed is situated to a pipe that made constant noise throughout the night. However, I was so exhausted that I fell asleep despite the noise. 

When I woke up, anyone else had already left. There was self-service breakfast available, which included bread and butter. There was a reminder on the wall that said to clean any dishes or utensils after use. 

After breakfast, I went for a walk and realized that the community was extremely busy, and everyone led a fast-paced life without taking any breaks. The city felt like a black hole, and it absorbed the people around it. People walked fast and hurriedly through the crowded streets. I limited myself to just walking, eating and sleeping for two days; however, I realized that this wasn't the place for me, so I had to leave.

I believed there's only one airport bus in this city. No wandering why a pair of Chinese lovers, who got on at the first stop, doubted whether this bus went to downtown. They sitted behind me, and talked about it.
So I turned my head and join them. I told what I knew about this bus line, I also told how I arrived and how I got transfer information before departure. They were surprised that I was traveling alone.
They came from Wuhan. Both of them loved motorbike, and that's why they met and fall in love.
By getting off, we found 
our guesthouses were located on the same street. We became friends, and I visited him and talked a lot. He is a interior designer with cool style long hair and long beard.

I stayed in a mixed 6-beds dormitory where two girls and three guys slept. Marilyn is from Paris. She said she have been China for several months.

Carl is another girl who comes from Germany. A night, in the dormitory, I asked a stupid question to her. "Do you have s child?" "I'm only 19" She said. I was so awkward. After that day, since her packages is still in the room, she missed. We all didn't know where she went. I leaved a message on her bag. Days later I received her texts, she went to Sandakan.

There're another two Chinese boys who are quite funny. The next morning, they invited me to join their tour to a island. I was so glad to join, for Marilyn was invited too.

### PULAU SAPI

This island named 'sapi' which word sounds like 'stupid' in Chinese.

## SEMPORNA ยน

<a-times :times="1" location="SEMPORNA"></a-times>

After landing, I found my phone was out of power. I found a store selling phone cards to charge. A local driver found me and asked me am I the passager they are looking for. I didn't know what name the girl is and I am not sure weather this was the bus she was at, so I declined.

Then a rude Brazil guy came and bought a phone card. I asked if I take a ride. He didn't wish to at first, and then he said he didn't mind if the driver say so. I found we have the same destination after talking to the driver. I got on the minibus after agree that I will pay the translate fee.

When we checked in, we discovered we were assigned to the same room. Feng Cheche and another girl, who learned scuba diving at the store, were also staying in our room. Since we talked, Feng Cheche and I realized that we shared the same destination, Penang, a few days later.

The Brazilian guy was extremely rude, stating that he did not like anyone sleeping on the upper bunk. As a result, I had to relocate to the neighboring room for the night.

My stay here was only for one night. The next morning, the Brazilian and I hugged and he apologized to me.

Afterward, I boarded Uncle Chang's boat.

### PULAU MABUL

There's only a Chinese guy and I at first when checking in. Three beautiful girls came who said Cantonese who I believed they're from Hong Kong When aboard. And we also know another girl who was traveling with her mother. 

<a-hotel name="Uncle Chang Bungalow" date="2014-01-09" nights="2" points="4.2477133,118.6271726"></a-hotel>

The first person I met was a boy from Chengdu, whom Uncle Chang even drove to the bank to withdraw money. On the boat, we saw three girls speaking Cantonese. Assuming they were from Hong Kong, upon inquiry, I learned that they were actually from Guangzhou. One of them was named Butterfly, and because another girl's clothing had a tomato pattern on it, I called her Tomato Soup. They stayed in the room next to ours, but only for half a day before heading off to Mabul Island. There was also another girl from Chongqing on the island, who came diving with her mother. We all admired her courage.

The boat that took us to the island had to pass by an oil platform that had been converted into a diving shop. Our boat had stopped under the platform for a while because there was a girl on board who was heading to the diving shop.

A popular game here involves a small iron ring suspended from a long string in mid-air, with a small iron hook mounted on a post opposite. The objective is to swing the ring over and hook it onto the hook. It's an addictive game that most people initially struggle with, as the ring repeatedly swings back and forth without success.

I spent a whole hour playing before I discovered the trick. First, one needs to make the ring follow an elliptical trajectory as it swings across. Secondly, applying a spinning force to the ring can help; a proper spin makes it easier for the ring to latch onto the hook.

I didn't know the names of these two girls, nor did I have their contact information; all I remembered was that they seemed to be from Shanghai. After others had gradually left the island, I got to know them and spent quite some time together.

I played more with the tall girl with long hair. Once, she and I found a hermit crab on a platform. Another time, we went to the island itself where we saw indigenous people and stationed troops. When we returned, we were told that everyone had been looking for us as the snorkeling boat had already departed without us. We had no choice but to wait for the next one.

The short-haired girl made two impressions on me: one was when she wore a white bikini while snorkeling, and the other was that several staff members at the dive shop seemed to fancy her and asked me about her.

Later, by chance, we left the island together. We took the same vehicle provided by the dive shop; they headed to Tawau Airport while I went to downtown Tawau.

Sharing our room was a man from Taiwan who had come for diving. He was always sharing his diving experiences with us and told me that just a few days earlier he had seen several turtles under this very platform, assuring me that if I paid attention, I would surely see them too. So, in the following days, I enjoyed spending time on the platform, hoping to catch sight of these creatures. However, not a single turtle appeared.

One time, their diving boat failed to return on schedule, causing concern among the platform staff. Eventually, it did return, and the Taiwanese man informed me that they had encountered a "washing machine current" at Sipadan, which nearly prevented them from returning safely. It was incidents like these that influenced me and eventually led me down the path of diving as well.

The weather here in January is indeed quite unpleasant. One day, the sky was completely overcast and a strong wind blew across the platform. It was said that there was a typhoon coming from the Philippines.

People on the island were all sea gypsies, with several young men among them who had dark skin and were especially friendly. One of them could even play the guitar and sing. On another occasion, a group of Malay tourists appeared out of nowhere to ask for a photo with me. I didn't even know them, but they told me they were from Penang, though not the George Town that I was headed to.

The crew had begun to shout to all the snorkelers to return to the boat. She was furthest away from the boat, and the current was strong, so I quickly swam over, took her hand, and tried to swim towards the boat.

### SALT DOG

I went to dinner with her, and then followed her to an open-air bar. We talked about some things, such as her experience in China and why she wanted to go back to France. She recommended a wine that was soaked in salt, and she was surprised that I finished it so quickly and ordered another one. Afterwards, we walked back to the hostel along the road. When I entered the room, she was video chatting with her boyfriend on the bed, and I said hello.

The next morning, I was bored flipping through my book when he came over and squatted at my feet, telling me that she was going to KK Mountain with another tourist here. So, we parted ways. It was a strange feeling. I also wanted to go up the mountain with her, but my itinerary was already set.

When I get back to the room, a young girl is sitting on the upper bed and waves to me. She's Isis from Hongkong.

To get to the night market, we had to walk a few streets, but it was completely worth it. We first tried Four-Fruit Soup, and the soy sauce chicken feet were amazing; we had them several times. Danni and I also shared a durian that was so delicious that I haven't been able to find one as good since. Later on, Dannii and I came back and got takeout fried rice noodles.

### BEACH

Isis went Langkawi.

The rest of us took buses along the coast, heading to a public beach. The coastline was truly beautiful, but I don't remember anything particularly special about it. In fact, I've even doubted whether this event really happened or if we simply walked around and left.

When we first arrived at the mountain, it seemed as though we could hear monkeys calling. However, after walking deep into the mountains without seeing a single one, we thought that the monkeys wouldn't show themselves. After walking for a while longer, a small shop appeared by the roadside, and I bought an ice cream cone to eat as I walked. Suddenly, I noticed a monkey on the path ahead, staring at me with angry eyes, as if wanting to snatch my cone. Soon, I spotted two smaller monkeys by the side of the road as well. In the end, I shared some of my ice cream with them.

As it got dark quickly, we descended the mountain. At the foot of the mountain, at a junction, we ate at a street stall. Around six o'clock, the owner suddenly started packing up. In China, six o'clock is when night markets are just starting to open. We all said that maybe Malaysians value life more than making money.
