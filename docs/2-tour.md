My second journey began with a heart-stopping race against time.
It was a domestic flight delay that nearly caused me to miss my international connection.

My original plan was straightforward: take a domestic flight to Kunming, then transfer to an AirAsia flight to Kuala Lumpur. I had calculated plenty of buffer time, but fate had other plans. When I arrived at the boarding gate in Chongqing far earlier than necessary, I was shocked to see the aircraft already parked there. To my bewilderment, the plane was physically present yet completely inaccessible. The aircraft’s schedule for the day was a complex loop predetermined by the airline: it had just arrived from another city and was scheduled to fly to a third destination before finally returning to Chongqing to pick me up for the Kunming leg. In a twist of dramatic irony, I had to watch my plane take off, wait two hours for it to complete its round trip, and only then could I board. Essentially, the delay meant the plane had to “lap” me before I could get on.

Two hours later, I finally touched down in Kunming. The delay had completely consumed my carefully reserved buffer time; in fact, the international flight was now scheduled to depart in less than thirty minutes. Panic set in immediately. To make matters worse, I had checked in my backpack—a completely unnecessary decision since it could have been carry-on luggage. Now, I was forced to stand helplessly at the baggage carousel, watching the minutes tick away while waiting for my bag. Since I had booked separate tickets rather than a connected itinerary, I could not use the seamless international transfer channel. I had to collect my luggage, exit the domestic arrivals hall, and sprint to the international departure counter to check in all over again.

The situation was frantic. On the plane to Kunming, I had desperately sought help from a flight attendant, only to receive a brisk reply: “You’ll make it if you run fast.” That advice proved both terrifying and true. At the check-in counter, the agent was just about to close the system when she spotted me. “One last passenger for seat 1A!” she announced loudly. The immigration process was equally surreal; I nervously asked the passengers ahead if I could cut in line. To my surprise, the officer smiled and said, “It’s fine; the passengers you jumped ahead of are on the same flight as you.”

When I finally sprinted to the boarding gate, there were only five minutes left before closure. Yet, in a moment of strange calm amidst the chaos, I even managed to slip into the restroom. As I washed my hands, the adrenaline slowly faded, and my suspended heart finally settled. I was the last person to board, stepping onto the plane just as the gate was closing.

Upon landing at LCCT in Kuala Lumpur past midnight, I took the airport bus to KL Sentral. My plan was to transfer to the Monorail to reach my hostel, but the station had already shut down for the night. Left with no choice, I hailed a taxi. As I waited, I noticed the surrounding area looked somewhat sinister, with men frequently entering and exiting nearby buildings. “Is this a red-light district? Is it dangerous?” I asked the driver as I got into the cab. He glanced at me, gave a short, grim nod, and simply replied, “Danger.”

That night, I finally arrived at Times Square, where my hostel was nestled.
The dormitory was steeped in silence, broken only by a chorus of loud snoring from the other guests.

Everyone was obviously asleep because they were snoring loudly. I walked quietly and tried not to wake anyone up. My bed was beside a pipe that made constant noise throughout the night. However, I was so exhausted that I fell asleep despite the noise.

When I woke the next morning, the room was empty; everyone else had already vanished into the city. A self-service breakfast awaited me—toast, butter, and instant coffee. A note pinned to the wall gently reminded guests to wash their own dishes, adding a touch of practical efficiency to the quiet morning.

Stepping outside, I was immediately engulfed by the city’s frenetic energy. The community was a hive of activity; people rushed past with heads down, living at a breakneck pace that allowed for no pauses, no breaths, and no moments of stillness. It felt as though an invisible force was driving them forward.

This sense of relentless momentum followed me into my dining experiences. Determined to avoid high-end restaurants and crowded tourist traps, I sought out small Indian eateries, hoping for a slower, more affordable meal. However, even here, the rhythm was different. At the first restaurant I visited, no spoons were provided. When I asked for one, the owner simply demonstrated how to eat with hands, treating my request as a cultural misunderstanding rather than a preference. It was only after I insisted several times that he found a spoon for me. I shared this anecdote with Jing Yuman, knowing that having studied in Malaysia, she would appreciate such a raw slice of local cultural nuance. Sitting alone with my food, I did not feel like an outsider struggling to adapt; rather, I felt like a traveler observing a distinct way of life.

It was then that the metaphor struck me: this city felt like a black hole. Just as a black hole’s gravity traps light, the city’s intense, unyielding pace seemed to absorb the individuality and energy of everyone within it. The hurried strangers on the street, the impersonal rules at the hostel, and even the resistance to a simple request for a spoon—all were symptoms of a place that consumed time and spirit without giving anything back.

For two days, I limited my existence to the bare essentials: walking, eating, and sleeping. But with each passing hour, the realization grew stronger: this environment was suffocating me. The city demanded a speed and intensity that I could not sustain, nor did I wish to. It wasn’t just busy; it was overwhelming. Recognizing that this was not the place for me, I leaved.

I had operated under the assumption that there was only one airport bus line serving the city. Perhaps this explained the uncertainty I overheard behind me. A young Chinese couple, who had boarded at the first stop, were whispering anxiously to each other, doubting whether this bus actually headed to the downtown area.

Curiosity prompted me to turn around and join their discussion. I shared what I knew about the route, recounting how I had verified the transfer information before my departure. They listened with relief, and as our conversation deepened, they expressed surprise that I was traveling entirely alone. It was only then that I learned they were from Wuhan. They shared a charming story: both were passionate motorbike enthusiasts, and it was this shared love for riding that had brought them together and sparked their romance.

As fate would have it, after we disembarked and began walking, we discovered that our accommodations were located on adjacent streets, just a stone’s throw away from each other. This coincidence marked the beginning of a genuine friendship. Over the next few days, we stayed in close contact. I even visited their guesthouse, where we spent hours sipping tea and chatting. Their lodging was nestled right against a lush mountain backdrop. They excitedly told me that they had spotted monkeys roaming in the hills behind their house—a wild touch to their urban stay that I had completely missed in my solitary rush.

The hostel I stayed at was a hidden gem, accessible only through a discreet door that opened onto a narrow stairway leading up to the second-floor reception. The place was managed by a kind-hearted, slightly plump middle-aged local woman who ran the business with genuine warmth.

One day, as I passed the front desk, she urgently beckoned me over. Despite our language barrier, she gestured for me to follow her upstairs to the third floor. We arrived at a room occupied by a young Chinese girl who was visibly distressed. It turned out there was a large cockroach in the room, terrifying both the guest and the owner. Although I am no fan of insects myself, I reluctantly agreed to help. Summoning my courage, I armed myself with a slipper and successfully dispatched the intruder. Upon returning to the reception, the owner, in her gracious manner, offered me a cold drink from the fridge as a token of gratitude. I gladly accepted, deeply appreciating her thoughtful gesture.

My sleeping quarters were in a mixed six-bed dormitory on the second floor, shared with two other girls and three guys. The mix of nationalities made for some memorable interactions.

There was Carl, a girl from Germany. One night, in an attempt to make conversation, I asked her a rather tactless question: “Do you have a child?” She looked at me, bewildered, and replied, “I’m only nineteen!” I was mortified by my own awkwardness. Shortly after that incident, Carl disappeared. Her luggage remained in the room, but she was nowhere to be found. None of us knew where she had gone. Worried, I left a note on her bag. Days later, I received a text from her; she had spontaneously decided to travel to Sandakan.

Then there was Marilyn from Paris, who mentioned she had been traveling in China for several months. We also had two Chinese boys in the room who were quite humorous. One of them had a nickname back home: “Spinach” (Bo Cai). Since neither Marilyn nor I knew the word for this specific vegetable in English, we struggled to explain it. Finally, in a moment of linguistic improvisation, we told Marilyn his name was simply “Vegetable.” To our amusement, the nickname stuck.

The next morning, while I was enjoying breakfast, “Vegetable” approached me and invited me to join their group tour to a nearby island. I was thrilled to accept, especially when I learned that Marilyn had been invited as well. It seemed my lonely journey was about to become a shared adventure.

### PULAU SAPI

The destination was an island named Sapi. To our Chinese ears, the name sounded suspiciously like "shǎ bī" (stupid), so we jokingly refused to call it by its real name. Instead, we rechristened it "Mermaid Island," a title that proved to be far more than just a joke.

We spent the afternoon snorkeling in the shallow waters. Although the seabed was littered with patches of dead coral, the crystal-clear water created a mesmerizing stage. It was there that I witnessed the origin of Marilyn’s nickname. As she dove beneath the surface, her movements were incredibly fluid and graceful. Through my camera lens, I captured a stunning shot of her gliding silently among the fish, her silhouette framed by the shimmering sunlight filtering from above. She looked exactly like a real-life mermaid. It wasn’t a trick of the light or an overactive imagination; the resemblance was uncanny. From that moment on, "Mermaid" wasn’t just a playful tease—it was her definitive title among us.

After lunch, a divergence of opinions arose regarding our next activity. Marilyn was eager to try parasailing, dreaming of soaring high above the turquoise sea. However, "Vegetable" hesitated, deeming the activity too expensive and opting out. Seeing this as a unique opportunity to share the sky with our "Mermaid"—and perhaps to capture another magical moment—I immediately agreed to join her, leaving Vegetable to enjoy the beach below.

The adventure, however, came with a steep price. Upon returning from the island, I discovered that my back had been severely sunburned. The pain was immediate and intense. Over the next few days, large patches of skin began to peel off, a painful but vivid reminder of my day under the tropical sun.

### THE BLACK GUY

Originally, my itinerary was fixed well in advance; I had purchased all flight tickets early, allocating only a few days for a stopover in Kota Kinabalu. However, upon discovering the pristine diving spots in Semporna, I felt compelled to incorporate this destination into my tight schedule. This adjustment inevitably fragmented my time in Kota Kinabalu, forcing me to cut my stay short. Consequently, the following day, I had to reluctantly forgo further underwater exploration and embark on the next leg of my journey.

<a-flight flight="AK6262" departure="BKI" destination="TWU" departure-time="2014-01-08 16:05" arrive-time="2014-01-08 17:00"></a-flight>

While waiting in the airport lounge, I encountered a Black man who claimed to have a special affinity for Chinese people, citing a previous visit to Guangdong. With feigned earnestness, he boasted about how adored he was by the local girls, going so far as to claim that virgins threw themselves at him.

Although he seemed to derive great pleasure from recounting these tales, I found his company increasingly tedious.

As boarding commenced, he mentioned his seat was in Row 28 and inquired about mine, clearly hoping to continue our conversation on the plane. With a subtle hint of smugness, I informed him that I was seated in Row 6, within the premium cabin. Thus, while he proceeded toward the rear door, I boarded through the front. In doing so, I ensured that I would never see him again.

## SEMPORNA

<a-times :times="1" location="SEMPORNA"></a-times>

Prior to the trip, aware that hailing a taxi in Semporna is notoriously difficult, I had arranged online to share a ride from the airport with a fellow traveler. However, upon landing, I encountered an immediate predicament: my phone battery had died. I stepped outside the terminal to find a shop selling phone cards so I could recharge and contact my partner.

While I was there, a local driver approached me, asking if I was the passenger he had been sent to pick up. Since my phone was off, I did not know my partner's name, nor could I confirm if this was the correct vehicle. Hesitant and unsure, I declined the offer. As I would later discover, it was indeed the right car, and my partner was furious at my no-show.

Shortly after, a rude Brazilian man arrived to buy a phone card. Seizing the opportunity, I asked if I could join his ride. Initially reluctant, he eventually agreed, provided the driver consented. After confirming with the driver that we shared the same destination, I boarded the minibus, agreeing to cover my share of the transportation fare.

```

Upon checking into our accommodation—a modest dive lodge—we discovered to our surprise that we had been assigned to the same room. Also staying there were Feng Cheche, the very partner I had missed at the airport, and another girl who had just signed up for scuba diving lessons. Once we began talking, Feng Cheche and I realized we had both planned to travel to Penang in a few days.

However, the atmosphere was tense. The Brazilian man was extremely abrasive, declaring that he refused to let anyone sleep on the top bunk of his bunk bed. Unwilling to argue, and since my itinerary allowed for only a single night here, I simply found an empty dormitory nextdoor and settled on one of the beds. I stayed there fully clothed and without a blanket, just making do until morning.

The following morning, as I prepared to depart, the Brazilian man approached me. We shared a brief hug, and he offered a sincere apology for his behavior the previous night. With that matter resolved, I boarded Uncle Chang's boat.

### PULAU MABUL


```<a-img>

Before boarding the boat, I coincidentally met a fellow traveler from Chengdu while Uncle Chang, the proprietor of the local dive shop, was driving him to the bank. Once on board, I noticed three girls speaking Cantonese. Initially assuming they were from Hong Kong, I politely inquired and learned they were actually from Guangzhou. One introduced herself as Butterfly; another wore a distinctive outfit adorned with a tomato pattern, which prompted me to affectionately nickname her "Tomato Soup."


<a-hotel name="Uncle Chang Bungalow" date="2014-01-09" nights="2" points="118.6271726,4.2477133"></a-hotel>

At our accommodation, we shared a room with a diver from Taiwan. He enthusiastically recounted his underwater experiences, telling me that just days prior, he had spotted several sea turtles right beneath this very platform. He confidently assured me that with a keen eye, I would surely encounter them as well. Motivated by his words, I spent considerable time on the platform over the following days, eagerly scanning the waters. Regrettably, not a single turtle appeared.

On one occasion, anxiety spread among the platform staff when a diving boat failed to return on schedule. When it finally docked safely, the Taiwanese diver revealed that the team had encountered a perilous "washing machine current" near Sipadan, which had nearly jeopardized their safe return. Witnessing such dramatic incidents—where danger and wonder coexisted—profoundly impacted me. It was these very experiences that ultimately inspired me to embark on my own journey into the world of diving.

Additionally, we encountered a girl from Chongqing diving alongside her mother on the platform, a sight that filled us all with admiration for her courage.

### KAPALAI

The three girls from Guangdong had planned only a brief half-day stopover; their itinerary involved snorkeling at Kapalai before proceeding to Mataking Island. Our boat ferried them towards Kapalai, taking a route that passed the Seaventure Dive Rig—a distinctive offshore oil platform repurposed into a diving resort. We paused beneath the towering structure to drop off a fellow passenger, a girl who was scheduled to stay there.

```<a-img>
name:girl2rig
```

As I gazed up at the rig, I couldn't help but wonder how intriguing it must be to live and dive from such a unique platform.

```<a-img>
name:mabul-2
```

Upon arriving at Kapalai, a resort renowned for its crystalline waters and stilted villas, we immediately donned our snorkeling gear. The three girls from Guangdong and I ventured further out than the rest, swimming until we reached the most distant water villa on the edge of the reef. The scenery was breathtaking, but our isolation soon became a concern.

<a-gallery :img="[{name:'kapalai-1'},{name:'kapalai-2'},{name:'kapalai-3'}]"></a-gallery>

Suddenly, urgent shouts from the crew pierced the air, signaling all snorkelers to return to the boat immediately. I scanned the surface and realized Butterfly was the furthest away, struggling against a strengthening current. Without hesitation, I swam to her side, grasped her hand firmly, and rolled onto my back. Adopting a steady backstroke, I began to pull us both towards the boat.

It was a wondrous and intimate sensation. As I stroked upward with rhythmic effort, keeping us afloat, Butterfly clung to my hand, her gaze fixed downward like a timid child mesmerized by the ocean floor below. In that moment, with the vast sea surrounding us and our hands tightly linked, a subtle, unspoken current of affection flowed between us. Although we parted ways shortly after, the existence of this ambiguous connection was indeed confirmed during our conversations several months later.


### PULAU MABUL

A favorite pastime on the platform involved a simple yet challenging game: swinging a small iron ring suspended from a string to hook it onto a stationary metal peg positioned opposite. It was an addictive diversion that initially frustrated most players, as the ring would stubbornly swing back and forth, eluding capture time and again. I spent a solid hour mastering it before finally discerning the trick: one must guide the ring in an elliptical trajectory and apply a subtle spinning force, which stabilizes its path and allows it to latch onto the hook with satisfying precision.

The weather in January, however, was notoriously inclement. One day, the sky turned a bruised purple under heavy overcast clouds, and fierce winds whipped across the deck. Rumors spread that a typhoon was brewing in the Philippines, sending shivers of anticipation through the resort.

Seeking shelter from the gale, a group of local Bajau Laut, often referred to as "sea nomads," gathered on the platform. Among them were several young men with sun-bronzed skin and radiant smiles. One of them strummed a guitar, filling the windy afternoon with melodious songs that warmed our hearts. In a spontaneous moment of camaraderie, a group of Malay tourists, who had appeared as if out of nowhere, approached me to request a photo. Though they were complete strangers, they explained warmly that they were from Penang—just not the George Town district I was destined to visit soon. Their unexpected friendliness served as a bright spot amidst the gloomy weather, reminding me of the genuine hospitality found in these remote corners of the world.

After my initial group of friends had dispersed, I found myself in the company of two new companions. Although I never learned their names nor exchanged contact details, I distinctly remember them being from Shanghai. As the island gradually emptied out, we bonded and spent a considerable amount of time together.

```<a-img>
name:mabul-8.jpg
dir:privacy
```

I spent most of my time with the taller girl, who had long flowing hair. Our days were filled with simple discoveries; once, we delighted in observing a hermit crab scuttling across the platform. On another occasion, we ventured onto the nearby inhabited island, where we encountered indigenous locals and observed stationed military personnel. However, our exploration made us lose track of time. Upon returning, we were greeted with panic: the snorkeling boat had already set sail without us. With no other option, we resigned ourselves to waiting for the next scheduled trip, sharing a laugh over our carelessness.

```<a-img>

```

```<a-img>

The girl with short hair left two vivid impressions on me. The first was the striking image of her in a white bikini while snorkeling, exuding confidence amidst the blue waters. The second was the noticeable attention she received from the dive shop staff; several of them were clearly taken with her and frequently inquired about her identity.

Coincidentally, our journeys off the island aligned. We shared the same transfer vehicle provided by the dive shop, though our paths diverged upon arrival in Tawau. They headed to the airport for their flights, while I proceeded to the town center. It was a typical transient travel friendship—intense while it lasted, yet ending as quietly as it began.

## TAWAU

Upon reaching Tawau, our paths finally diverged. The two girls disembarked at the airport terminal, ready to catch their flights, while I continued my journey further into the city center, as my own flight was not scheduled until the following morning.

<a-hotel name="VS Hotel" date="2014-01-11" nights="1" points="117.8818416595459,4.244709464515594"></a-hotel>

After checking into my accommodation, I decided to take a leisurely stroll through the streets to soak in the local atmosphere. The evening air was lively, and I soon found a modest local eatery to settle down for dinner. To my delight, the warmth I had experienced on the islands followed me here; the locals were equally friendly and welcoming. A simple exchange with the restaurant owner or a smile from a passerby was enough to make me feel at home, bringing a gentle close to this chapter of my solo adventure.

## KOTA KINABALU

<a-flight flight="AK6269" departure="TWU" destination="BKI" departure-time="2014-01-12 10:15" arrive-time="2014-01-12 11:05"></a-flight>

Upon my return to Kota Kinabalu, the hostel room was deserted. As evening fell, I reunited with Marilyn, and we promptly made plans for dinner. Afterward, she suggested visiting a nearby spot for a nightcap.

### SALT DOG

I followed her to an open-air bar. We talked about some things, such as her experience in China and why she wanted to go back to France. She recommended a wine that was soaked in salt, and she was surprised that I finished it so quickly and ordered another one. Afterwards, we walked back to the hostel along the road. When I entered the room, she was video chatting with her boyfriend on the bed, and I said hello.

I followed her to a lively open-air bar. Our conversation drifted across various topics, ranging from her experiences in China to her reasons for returning to France. She recommended a local wine infused with a distinct salty note. To her surprise, I finished the glass swiftly and ordered another. Later, we strolled back to the hostel along the quiet streets. Upon entering the room, I found her lying on the bed, video-chatting with her boyfriend; I offered a polite greeting before settling in.

The next morning, I was listlessly browsing through my book when Marilyn approached me. She crouched down by my feet and gently broke the news: she would be heading to Mount Kinabalu with another tourist she had met here. Thus, our paths diverged. A strange sense of melancholy washed over me. I had secretly hoped to climb the mountain with her, but my itinerary was predetermined and unchangeable.

Once again, I found myself left in the sole company of the hostel cat. Much like my own idle state, the creature spent its hours gazing out from the balcony, lost in contemplation of the world beyond. In that shared silence, the cat and I seemed to understand each other perfectly.

My room was situated at the very end of the corridor on the second floor, accessible via a winding black iron spiral staircase. It was equipped with bunk beds and a private ensuite bathroom.
Initially, I was the solitary occupant of this space. Later, Feng Cheche joined me, and we spent some time conversing at a small round table just outside the hostel entrance.

Upon returning to the room after our chat, I was greeted by an unexpected sight: a young girl was perched on the top bunk, waving enthusiastically at me. She introduced herself as Isis Yu, a traveler from Hong Kong.

### LITTLE INDIA

I promptly introduced Isis to Feng Cheche. The three of us hit it off immediately and made plans to explore the city together the following day. True to our word, the next morning we set out for Little India.

### JETTY

A fresh day commenced with a new itinerary. Our first stop was the jetty, where we soaked in the harbor views before detouring to a separate ticketing office to secure Isis’s ferry passage to Langkawi. With that errand completed, we headed to Fort Cornwallis, a historic seaside citadel, to rest and explore.

### DANNI

As we concluded our visit and began to depart, walking along the coastal path near the entrance, we spotted a young girl standing alone by the water, focused on taking selfies.

Observing her solitary efforts, Feng Cheche exclaimed, "What a cute girl taking selfies! Let me help her with that." Encouraged by her enthusiasm, we approached the stranger with friendly intentions and offered to take some photos for her. She accepted gratefully, and this simple act of kindness instantly broke the ice.

As we reviewed the photos together, conversation flowed naturally. She revealed that she was traveling solo and hailed from Chongqing. Sensing a kindred spirit in a fellow lone traveler, we asked about her accommodation. She couldn’t recall the specific name of her hostel but remembered it was located on Love Lane—the very same street where Isis and I were staying. As fate would have it, we were all heading in the same direction, so we invited her to walk with us, musing on the possibility that we might even be under the same roof.

Upon arrival, wouldn’t you know it, she led us straight to the exact hostel where Isis and I were lodged! The coincidence was astonishing. For a moment, we entertained the delightful speculation: Could we possibly be roommates? It was a perfect example of the serendipitous occurrences that make traveling so magical, turning a simple offer to capture a moment into an instant friendship.

### NIGHT MARKET

That evening, we embarked on a culinary expedition to the night market, the furthest point on our itinerary. We meandered through lively streets to reach the bustling hub, where every step proved worthwhile. Our gastronomic adventure began with the famous "Four-Fruit Soup." Its unique blend of flavors was so captivating that we returned to the stall multiple times. Equally remarkable were the braised chicken feet in soy sauce; their succulent texture and rich taste left us in awe. Later, Danni—the solo traveler from Chongqing we had met earlier—and I shared an exquisitely creamy durian. Its unparalleled sweetness set a benchmark in my memory that I have yet to encounter elsewhere. We capped off our feast with some scrumptious fried rice noodles before heading to a local bar, which was conveniently located closer to our hostel.

### BAR

For Danni, this was her first-ever visit to a bar, and her excitement was palpable. Her eyes sparkled with curiosity as she took in the dim lights and the clinking of glasses. We found a cozy corner and spent hours immersed in lively conversation, sharing stories of our travels, dreams, and quirks. Time seemed to fly as we laughed and talked late into the night, thoroughly enjoying the camaraderie.

It was only after we finally left the bar, buoyed by good spirits but mindful of the late hour, that a shadow of caution fell over me as we began our final walk back to the accommodation. During my trip preparations, I had read warnings about Penang’s safety, specifically regarding fly-by bag snatchers on motorcycles. Although the girls were not carrying backpacks, I instinctively positioned them on the inner side of the sidewalk, away from the road, as we navigated the quieter, dimly lit streets.

Suddenly, a motorcycle zoomed past us, carrying two riders. The passenger in the backseat cast a peculiar, lingering glance in my direction. "Could this be one of those snatch-and-grab attempts?" I wondered, my heart skipping a beat.

Almost immediately after this tense moment, a police motorcycle cruised up alongside us, also manned by two officers. The officer seated at the rear eyed me intently, seemingly assessing whether I was in danger or had just witnessed a crime. This striking juxtaposition—a suspicious glance from a potential threat followed instantly by a vigilant stare from the law—underscored the city's complex reality. It highlighted both the ever-present need for caution and the reassuring presence of authority ready to intervene. We all agreed in hindsight that it had been a potentially dangerous encounter, narrowly averted by awareness and a bit of luck, serving as a sobering end to an otherwise joyful night.

### BEACH

The following day marked a farewell; Isis departed for Langkawi to continue her solo journey.

With our group now smaller, the rest of us embarked on a bus ride along the scenic coastline, bound for a public beach. The views were undeniably picturesque, with the azure sea stretching endlessly against the horizon. However, despite confirming that this excursion truly took place, my recollection of it remains surprisingly vague. No specific event or unique moment stands out to distinguish that afternoon from any other. It was a scene of generic beauty—pleasant yet unremarkable. In hindsight, those hours feel like a soft-focus backdrop to our trip: real and experienced, but so devoid of dramatic peaks that they have faded into a gentle blur, leaving me with only the impression of sunlight and sea breeze, nothing more.

Later, Feng Cheche departed as her itinerary required.

### PENANG HILL

2014-01-16

With Feng Cheche’s departure, it was just Danni and I left. She suggested a visit to Penang Hill. On the morning of our trip, she spent considerable time meticulously applying her makeup. While waiting for her to get ready, I passed the time by taking numerous photos of her with my camera.

Upon arriving at the mountain foothills, the air was filled with the distant calls of monkeys, creating an expectation of wildlife encounters. However, as we ventured deeper into the trails without spotting a single primate, we began to assume they were merely elusive ghosts of the forest. After walking for some time, we stumbled upon a small roadside shop where I purchased an ice cream cone. As I walked along savoring the treat, I suddenly noticed a monkey on the path ahead, glaring at me with intense eyes as if plotting to seize my cone. Soon after, I spotted two smaller monkeys lurking by the roadside as well. In a moment of shared curiosity, I ended up sharing portions of my ice cream with them.

As dusk fell rapidly, we descended the mountain. At the foot of the hill, near a junction, we stopped at a street stall for dinner. Around six o’clock, the owner unexpectedly began packing up his stall. In China, this hour marks the bustling opening of night markets. We remarked on the contrast, musing that perhaps Malaysians prioritize enjoying life over maximizing profits.

The next day, Danni departed for Kota Kinabalu.

### GERGORE TOWN

Having spent several days in Penang, logic dictated that I should have moved on to explore new destinations. However, lacking a pre-planned itinerary and feeling too lethargic to formulate new strategies, I decided to extend my stay at my current hostel, hoping to wait for Isis’s return from Langkawi. Fate, however, had other plans. The owner informed me that the upcoming weekend coincided with a Malaysian national holiday, and every room was fully booked. Consequently, I was forced to vacate. Shortly after my departure, Isis returned, but we missed the chance to reunite.

## KUALA LUMPUR

I traveled back to Kuala Lumpur by bus and checked into a hostel on the famous Jalan Alor. To my surprise, the atmosphere was desolate. There were only two other foreign travelers in the entire building, deeply engrossed in a discussion about how to find accommodations that were merely five dollars cheaper. True to their frugal words, they moved out the following day, leaving me as the sole guest in the vast, empty hostel.

<a-hotel name="Hotel Budget Inn Jalan Alor" date="2014-01-19" nights="2"></a-hotel>

Subsequently, I spent my time wandering around Kuala Lumpur and engaging in some mundane activities.

Subsequently, I spent my days wandering aimlessly around Kuala Lumpur, engaging in mundane activities that offered little joy. A profound sense of listlessness washed over me, mirroring the intense discomfort and alienation I had felt upon my initial arrival in the city.
