I nearly missed my international flight.

I had planned to take a domestic flight to Kunming first, and I thought I would have plenty of time to catch the airline to Kula Lumpur. When I arrived at the boarding gate, it was too early, but to my surprise, the plane was already there. It was scheduled to fly from Kunming to Chongqing and then to another destination. After completing those routes, it would turn and went directly to Chongqing and take me to Kunming. The plane was there due a delay of previous schedule. I had to wait for it to leave and come back.

Two hours later, around the same time I had  reserved, I finally arrived at Kunming. When I rushed out of cabin, the next flight was already boarding. I realized that I had to wait for my package and recheck in, even though there was no international transfer channel.  I was the last persih checked in at the counter, and I boarded at the last minute just before gate close.

Taking airport bus from LCCT, I reached KL Sentral at midnight. I was going to took the Monorail, but the station was already shutdown. Thus, I had to took a taxi.

I get off at the Times Square where my hostel located.

Everyone was obviously asleep because they were snoring loudly. I walked quietly and tried to not wake anyone up. My bed was situated to a pipe that made constant noise throughout the night. However, I was so exhausted that I fell asleep despite the noise. 

When I woke up, anyone else had already left. There was self-service breakfast available, which included toast ,butter and coffee. There was a reminder on the wall that said to clean any dishes or cups after use. 

After breakfast, I went for a walk and realized that the community was extremely busy, and everyone led a fast-paced life without taking any breaks. 

In the context of dining, I've steered clear of high-end restaurants and avoided crowded venues. Instead, I always frequent Indian eateries because they tend to be less busy and affordable. The first Indian restaurant I visited didn't provide spoons. Had been asked, he showed me how to eat with my hands. Only after my persistent request did they manage to find a spoon for me. I even shared this experience with Jing, given that she had studied abroad here and might appreciate the cultural nuance.

The city felt like a black hole, and it absorbed the people around it. People walked fast and hurriedly through the crowded streets. I limited myself to just walking, eating and sleeping for two days; however, I realized that this wasn't the place for me, so I had to leave.

I believed there's only one airport bus in this city. No wandering why a pair of Chinese lovers, who got on at the first stop, doubted whether this bus went to downtown. They sitted behind me, and talked about it.
So I turned my head and join them. I told what I knew about this bus line, I also told how I arrived and how I got transfer information before departure. They were surprised that I was traveling alone.
They came from Wuhan. Both of them loved motorbike, and that's why they met and fall in love.
By getting off, we found 
our guesthouses were located on the same street. We became friends, and I visited him and talked a lot. He is a interior designer with cool style long hair and long beard.

<a-hotel name="Borneo Backpackers" date="2014-01-06" nights="2"></a-hotel>

The hostel I stayed at was located above a restaurant, accessible only through a discreet door that led to a stairway up to the second floor where the reception desk was situated. The owner, a kind-hearted, slightly plump middle-aged local woman, managed the place with warmth.

One day, as I passed by the front desk, she urgently beckoned me over, leading me upstairs to the third floor despite our language barrier. We arrived at a room occupied by a Chinese girl. It turned out there was a cockroach inside, which both the owner and the student were terrified of. Although I'm not particularly fond of cockroaches myself, I reluctantly agreed to help. Summoning my courage, I managed to dispatch the insect with my slipper.

Upon returning to the reception area, the owner, in her gracious manner, offered me a drink from the fridge as a token of gratitude. I gladly accepted her offer, appreciating the gesture.

My sleeping arrangement was in a mixed 6-bed dormitory on the second floor, shared with two girls and three guys.
Carl is one girl who comes from Germany. A night, in the dormitory, I asked a stupid question to her. "Do you have a child?" "I'm only 19" She said. I was so awkward. After that day, since her packages is still in the room, she missed. We all didn't know where she went. I leaved a message on her bag. Days later I received her texts, she went to Sandakan.

Marilyn from Paris is another. She said she have been China for several months. There're another two Chinese boys who are quite funny. One of them called "spinach". As there of us didn't know what is it in English, we had to hold Marilyn that his name is "vegetable".

The next morning, when I was enjoying breakfast, vegetable came and invited me to join their tour to an island. I was so glad to join, for Marilyn was invited too.

### PULAU SAPI

This island named "sapi" which word sounds like 'stupid' in Chinese. We perfered "mermaid island", because Marilyn was one.

We were snorkeling in the shallow waters where plenty of dead corals could be found. And there, I actually saw what appeared to be a "mermaid".

After lunch, Marilyn wanted to go parasailing. Vegetable thought it was too expensive and didn't want to. However, I saw this as an opportunity for a close encounter with the mermaid, so I agreed to it.

After returning from the island, I discovered that my back had been severely sunburned; and several days later, large patches of skin peeled off.

### THE BLACK GUY

In the original plan, I intended to stay in Kota Kinabalu for several days, even purchasing a return flight ticket. However, I later became attracted to Semporna and decided to insert this trip into my itinerary. Thus, the next day, I had to reluctantly leave behind the mermaid encounter and embark on a new journey.

<a-flight flight="AK6262" departure="BKI" destination="TWU" departure-time="2014-01-08 16:05" arrive-time="2014-01-08 17:00"></a-flight>

At the airport lounge, I encountered a black man who claimed to have an affinity for Chinese people and had even been to Guangdong. In earnest, he told me how much the girls there adored him, and how he even had virgins throwing themselves at him.

He seemed to take pleasure in recounting his stories to me, but I found him a bit annoying.

As we were boarding, he mentioned that he was seated in Row 28 and asked which row I was in, hoping to continue our conversation on the plane. With a hint of smugness, I told him Row 6 - the paid seats section. Consequently, while he headed for the rear entrance, I boarded through the front entrance. And thus, I never saw him again after that.

## SEMPORNA

<a-times :times="1" location="SEMPORNA"></a-times>

Before boarding the plane, I had found a carpool partner online with whom I arranged to share a ride from the airport.

After landing, I found my phone was out of power. I found a store selling phone cards to charge. A local driver found me and asked me am I the passager they are looking for. I didn't know what name the girl is and I am not sure weather this was the bus she was at, so I declined.

Then a rude Brazil guy came and bought a phone card. I asked if I take a ride. He didn't wish to at first, and then he said he didn't mind if the driver say so. I found we have the same destination after talking to the driver. I got on the minibus after agree that I will pay the translate fee.

When we checked in, we discovered we were assigned to the same room. Feng Cheche and another girl, who learned scuba diving at the store, were also staying in our room. Since we talked, Feng Cheche and I realized that we shared the same destination, Penang, a few days later.

The Brazilian guy was extremely rude, stating that he did not like anyone sleeping on the upper bunk. As a result, I had to relocate to the neighboring room for the night.

My stay here was only for one night. The next morning, the Brazilian and I hugged and he apologized to me.

Afterward, I boarded Uncle Chang's boat.

### PULAU MABUL

Before boarding, I met a guy from Chengdu while Uncle Chang was driving him to the bank.

<a-hotel name="Uncle Chang Bungalow" date="2014-01-09" nights="2" points="118.6271726,4.2477133"></a-hotel>

On the boat, we saw three girls speaking Cantonese. Assuming they were from Hong Kong, upon inquiry, I learned that they were actually from Guangzhou. One of them was named Butterfly, and because another girl's clothing had a tomato pattern on it, I called her Tomato Soup.

There was also another girl from Chongqing on the platform, who came diving with her mother. We all admired her courage.

Sharing our room was a man from Taiwan who had come for diving. He was always sharing his diving experiences with us and told me that just a few days earlier he had seen several turtles under this very platform, assuring me that if I paid attention, I would surely see them too. So, in the following days, I enjoyed spending time on the platform, hoping to catch sight of these creatures. However, not a single turtle appeared.

One time, their diving boat failed to return on schedule, causing concern among the platform staff. Eventually, it did return, and the Taiwanese man informed me that they had encountered a "washing machine current" at Sipadan, which nearly prevented them from returning safely. It was incidents like these that influenced me and eventually led me down the path of diving as well.

### KAPALAI

Three Guangdong girls were only staying for half a day, and they merely planned to go snorkeling at Kapalai before heading off to Mataking Island.

The boat ferried us over to Kapalai. It had to pass by the Seaventure Dive Rig, an offshore oil platform that had been repurposed into a diving shop. Our boat had stopped under the platform for a while because there was a girl on board who was heading to there.

```<a-img>
name:girl2rig
```

I was thinking how intriguing this diving platform must be.

```<a-img>
name:mabul-2
```

<a-gallery :img="[{name:'kapalai-1'},{name:'kapalai-2'},{name:'kapalai-3'}]"></a-gallery>

The crew had begun to shout to all the snorkelers to return to the boat. She was furthest away from the boat, and the current was strong, so I quickly swam over, took her hand, and tried to swim towards the boat.

It was a wondrous sensation, holding hands with her as I swam upward strenuously, while she gazed downward like a timid little one, her gaze fixed on the ocean floor.

It was quite evident that there existed an undercurrent of ambiguous feelings between us. Several months later, this was indeed confirmed during one of our conversations.

### PULAU MABUL

A popular game here involves a small iron ring suspended from a long string in mid-air, with a small iron hook mounted on a post opposite. The objective is to swing the ring over and hook it onto the hook. It's an addictive game that most people initially struggle with, as the ring repeatedly swings back and forth without success.

I spent a whole hour playing before I discovered the trick. First, one needs to make the ring follow an elliptical trajectory as it swings across. Secondly, applying a spinning force to the ring can help; a proper spin makes it easier for the ring to latch onto the hook.

The weather here in January is indeed quite unpleasant. One day, the sky was completely overcast and a strong wind blew across the platform. It was said that there was a typhoon coming from the Philippines.

People on the island were all sea gypsies, with several young men among them who had dark skin and were especially friendly. One of them could even play the guitar and sing. On another occasion, a group of Malay tourists appeared out of nowhere to ask for a photo with me. I didn't even know them, but they told me they were from Penang, though not the George Town that I was headed to.

```<a-img>

```

After the friends had all departed, I got to know two more girls.

I didn't know the names of they, nor did I have their contact information; all I remembered was that they seemed to be from Shanghai. After others had gradually left the island, I got to know them and spent quite some time together.

```<a-img>

I played more with the tall girl with long hair. Once, she and I found a hermit crab on a platform. Another time, we went to the island itself where we saw indigenous people and stationed troops. When we returned, we were told that everyone had been looking for us as the snorkeling boat had already departed without us. We had no choice but to wait for the next one.

The short-haired girl made two impressions on me: one was when she wore a white bikini while snorkeling, and the other was that several staff members at the dive shop seemed to fancy her and asked me about her.

Later, by chance, we left the island together. We took the same vehicle provided by the dive shop; they headed to Tawau Airport while I went to downtown Tawau.

Upon my return to Kota Kinabalu, the room was empty. As evening approached, I ran into Marilyn coming back, and we made plans to have dinner together. After our meal, she suggested going to a nearby spot for a couple of drinks.

### SALT DOG

I followed her to an open-air bar. We talked about some things, such as her experience in China and why she wanted to go back to France. She recommended a wine that was soaked in salt, and she was surprised that I finished it so quickly and ordered another one. Afterwards, we walked back to the hostel along the road. When I entered the room, she was video chatting with her boyfriend on the bed, and I said hello.

The next morning, I was bored flipping through my book when he came over and squatted at my feet, telling me that she was going to KK Mountain with another tourist here. So, we parted ways. It was a strange feeling. I also wanted to go up the mountain with her, but my itinerary was already set.

Thus, in the hostel, I was once again left with only a cat for company. This cat enjoyed gazing out from the balcony much like the idle me.

The room was at the end of the corridor. It was on the second floor, connected with black iron spiral stairs. It had bunk beds and its own bathroom. I was the only one guest in this room. Later, Fengchehe came to me. We chatted for a while at the small round table outside our hostel.

When I got back to the room, a young girl was sitting on the upper bed and waving to me. She was named Isis, from Hongkong. 

### LITTLE INDIA

I introduced her to the Cheche, and together we headed off to Little India.

### JETTY

We then went to the jetty together, and later accompanied Isis to book her ferry ticket to Langkawi. Following that, we took a rest in a nearby park.

### DANNI

We strolled leisurely along the coastline.
Fengcheche have been astonished, "What a cute self photography girl. Let me help you."
It turned out that there was a girl taking selfies nearby. After striking up a conversation, we discovered that she hailed from Chongqing.

When we asked her which hostel she was staying at, she couldn't quite remember the name but knew it was on Love Lane. As it happened, we were heading in the same direction and decided to walk together. There was a chance that, quite coincidentally, we might even be staying at the same hostel.

Upon arrival, wouldn't you know it, this turned out to be the exact hostel where Isis and I were staying! It was an amusing thought – what if we were actually in the same room? Such serendipitous occurrences do happen in the world.

### NIGHT MARKET

In the evening, we made plans to explore the night market together in search of a delicious meal.

```

To reach the bustling night market, we meandered through a few lively streets, and every step proved worthwhile. Our first gastronomic adventure involved sampling the Four-Fruit Soup, which was simply delightful; its unique flavor was so captivating that we couldn't resist having it multiple times throughout the evening. The soy sauce chicken feet were equally remarkable, leaving us in awe of their succulent texture and rich taste.

Danni and I also shared an incredibly luscious durian, one whose unparalleled sweetness and creamy goodness has been etched in my memory, making it a benchmark that I've yet to encounter again elsewhere. As the night progressed, Danni and I returned to the market for some scrumptious takeout – a serving of fried rice noodles that perfectly capped off our unforgettable culinary escapade at the night market.

Before arriving, I had heard about Penang's safety situation. Although the girls were not carrying backpacks, on our way back, I deliberately made sure they stayed closer to the inside of the sidewalk. It was at this moment that a motorcycle zoomed past me, with two people aboard; the passenger in the backseat gave me a peculiar look. "Could this be one of those snatch-and-grab incidents?" I thought to myself.

Right after my concern, a police motorcycle cruised by my side, also manned by two officers. The rear rider, a policeman, was eyeing me as well, seemingly assessing if I was in any kind of danger or had just encountered one. This juxtaposition underscored the city's vigilance against potential threats while also highlighting my own awareness and caution in navigating the streets of Penang.

We all agreed that the previous incident was a potentially dangerous encounter.

### BEACH

The next day, Isis went Langkawi.

The rest of us took buses along the coast, heading to a public beach. The coastline was truly beautiful, but I don't remember anything particularly special about it. In fact, I've even doubted whether this event really happened or if we simply walked around and left.

When we first arrived at the mountain, it seemed as though we could hear monkeys calling. However, after walking deep into the mountains without seeing a single one, we thought that the monkeys wouldn't show themselves. After walking for a while longer, a small shop appeared by the roadside, and I bought an ice cream cone to eat as I walked. Suddenly, I noticed a monkey on the path ahead, staring at me with angry eyes, as if wanting to snatch my cone. Soon, I spotted two smaller monkeys by the side of the road as well. In the end, I shared some of my ice cream with them.

As it got dark quickly, we descended the mountain. At the foot of the mountain, at a junction, we ate at a street stall. Around six o'clock, the owner suddenly started packing up. In China, six o'clock is when night markets are just starting to open. We all said that maybe Malaysians value life more than making money.

The next day, she departed for Kota Kinabalu.

### GERGORE TOWN

I had intended to extend my stay at the hostel for another two days, but the owner informed me that the upcoming weekend was a holiday and all rooms were fully booked. Consequently, I had no choice but to find alternative accommodations. Later on, Isis returned from Langkawi, but unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to meet up.

## KULA LUMPUR

I traveled back to Kuala Lumpur from Penang by bus and checked into a hostel on Jalan Alor. To my surprise, there were only two other foreign travelers at the hostel who were discussing where they could find accommodations that were five dollars cheaper. The following day, true to their word, they actually moved out to another place. Consequently, I found myself as the sole guest in the hostel.

Subsequently, I spent my time wandering around Kuala Lumpur and engaging in some mundane activities.
