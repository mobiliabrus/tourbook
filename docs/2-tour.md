My second journey began with a heart-stopping race against time,
a series of coincidences that nearly caused me to miss my international flight.

My original plan was straightforward: take a domestic flight to Kunming,
then transfer to an AirAsia flight to Kuala Lumpur.
I had calculated plenty of buffer time, but fate had other plans.
When I arrived at the boarding gate in Chongqing far earlier than necessary, I was shocked to see the aircraft already parked there.
To my bewilderment, the plane was physically present yet completely inaccessible.
Due to a delay in its previous leg, the plane’s itinerary for the day was a complex loop: it had just arrived from another city and was scheduled to fly to a third destination before finally returning to Chongqing to pick me up for the Kunming leg.In a twist of dramatic irony, I had to watch my plane take off empty, wait two hours for it to complete its round trip, and only then could I board.

Two hours later, I finally touched down in Kunming. The delay had completely consumed my carefully reserved buffer time; in fact, the international flight was now scheduled to depart in less than thirty minutes. Panic set in immediately. To make matters worse, I had checked in my backpack—a completely unnecessary decision since it could have been carry-on luggage. Now, I was forced to stand helplessly at the baggage carousel, watching the minutes tick away while waiting for my bag. Since I had booked separate tickets rather than a connected itinerary, I could not use the seamless international transfer channel. I had to collect my luggage, exit the domestic arrivals hall, and sprint to the international departure counter to check in all over again.

The situation was frantic. On the plane to Kunming, I had desperately sought help from a flight attendant, only to receive a brisk reply: “You’ll make it if you run fast.” That advice proved both terrifying and true. At the check-in counter, the agent was just about to close the system when she spotted me. “One last passenger for seat 1A!” she announced loudly. The immigration process was equally surreal; I nervously asked the passengers ahead if I could cut in line. To my surprise, the immigration officer smiled and said, “Go ahead, they are on the same flight as you.”

When I finally sprinted to the boarding gate, there were only five minutes left before closure. Yet, in a moment of strange calm amidst the chaos, I even managed to slip into the restroom. As I washed my hands, the adrenaline slowly faded, and my suspended heart finally settled. I was the last person to board, stepping onto the plane just as the gate was closing.

Upon landing at LCCT in Kuala Lumpur past midnight, I took the airport bus to KL Sentral. My plan was to transfer to the Monorail to reach my hostel, but the station had already shut down for the night. Left with no choice, I hailed a taxi. As I waited, I noticed the surrounding area looked somewhat sinister, with men frequently entering and exiting nearby buildings. “Is this a red-light district? Is it dangerous?” I asked the driver as I got into the cab. He glanced at me, gave a short, grim nod, and simply replied, “Danger.”

That night, I finally arrived at Times Square, where my hostel was nestled.
The dormitory was steeped in silence, broken only by a chorus of loud snoring from the other guests.

Everyone was obviously asleep because they were snoring loudly. I walked quietly and tried not to wake anyone up. My bed was beside a pipe that made constant noise throughout the night. However, I was so exhausted that I fell asleep despite the noise.
I tiptoed across the creaky floorboards, desperate not to disturb their slumber. My bed was positioned right next to an exposed pipe that hummed with a constant, irritating vibration throughout the night. Yet, sheer exhaustion overpowered the noise; I collapsed onto the mattress and drifted into a dreamless sleep almost instantly.

When I woke the next morning, the room was empty; everyone else had already vanished into the city. A self-service breakfast awaited me—toast, butter, and instant coffee. A note pinned to the wall sternly reminded guests to wash their own dishes, adding a touch of impersonal efficiency to the quiet morning.

Stepping outside, I was immediately engulfed by the city’s frenetic energy. The community was a hive of activity; people rushed past with heads down, living at a breakneck pace that allowed for no pauses, no breaths, and no moments of stillness. It felt as though an invisible force was driving them forward.

This sense of relentless momentum followed me into my dining experiences. Determined to avoid high-end restaurants and crowded tourist traps, I sought out small Indian eateries, hoping for a slower, more affordable meal. However, even here, the rhythm was different. At the first restaurant I visited, no spoons were provided. When I hesitantly asked for one, the owner simply demonstrated how to eat with my hands, treating my request as a cultural misunderstanding rather than a preference. It was only after my persistent pleading that he reluctantly found a spoon for me. I later shared this anecdote with Jing Yuman, knowing that having studied in Malaysia, she would appreciate such a raw slice of local cultural nuance. But in that moment, sitting alone with my food, I felt less like a traveler and more like an outsider struggling to adapt to a rigid system.

It was then that the metaphor struck me: this city felt like a black hole. Just as a black hole’s gravity traps light, the city’s intense, unyielding pace seemed to absorb the individuality and energy of everyone within it. The hurried strangers on the street, the impersonal rules at the hostel, and even the resistance to a simple request for a spoon—all were symptoms of a place that consumed time and spirit without giving anything back.

For two days, I limited my existence to the bare essentials: walking, eating, and sleeping. But with each passing hour, the realization grew stronger: this environment was suffocating me. The city demanded a speed and intensity that I could not sustain, nor did I wish to. It wasn’t just busy; it was overwhelming. Recognizing that this was not the place for me, I made the decisive choice to leave.

I had operated under the assumption that there was only one airport bus line serving the city. Perhaps this explained the uncertainty I overheard behind me. A young Chinese couple, who had boarded at the first stop, were whispering anxiously to each other, doubting whether this bus actually headed to the downtown area.

Curiosity prompted me to turn around and join their discussion. I shared what I knew about the route, recounting how I had verified the transfer information before my departure and detailing my own chaotic arrival. They listened with relief, and as our conversation deepened, they expressed surprise that I was traveling entirely alone. It was only then that I learned they were from Wuhan. They shared a charming story: both were passionate motorbike enthusiasts, and it was this shared love for riding that had brought them together and sparked their romance.

As fate would have it, after we disembarked and began walking, we discovered that our accommodations were located on adjacent streets, just a stone’s throw away from each other. This coincidence marked the beginning of a genuine friendship. Over the next few days, we stayed in close contact. I even visited their guesthouse, where we spent hours sipping tea and chatting. Their lodging was nestled right against a lush mountain backdrop. They excitedly told me that they had spotted monkeys roaming in the hills behind their house—a wild touch to their urban stay that I had completely missed in my solitary rush.

The hostel I stayed at was a hidden gem, accessible only through a discreet door that opened onto a narrow stairway leading up to the second-floor reception. The place was managed by a kind-hearted, slightly plump middle-aged local woman who ran the business with genuine warmth.

One day, as I passed the front desk, she urgently beckoned me over. Despite our language barrier, she gestured for me to follow her upstairs to the third floor. We arrived at a room occupied by a young Chinese girl who was visibly distressed. It turned out there was a large cockroach in the room, terrifying both the guest and the owner. Although I am no fan of insects myself, I reluctantly agreed to help. Summoning my courage, I armed myself with a slipper and successfully dispatched the intruder. Upon returning to the reception, the owner, in her gracious manner, offered me a cold drink from the fridge as a token of gratitude. I gladly accepted, deeply appreciating her thoughtful gesture.

My sleeping quarters were in a mixed six-bed dormitory on the second floor, shared with two other girls and three guys. The mix of nationalities made for some memorable interactions.

There was Carl, a girl from Germany. One night, in an attempt to make conversation, I asked her a rather tactless question: “Do you have a child?” She looked at me, bewildered, and replied, “I’m only nineteen!” I was mortified by my own awkwardness. Shortly after that incident, Carl disappeared. Her luggage remained in the room, but she was nowhere to be found. None of us knew where she had gone. Worried, I left a note on her bag. Days later, I received a text from her; she had spontaneously decided to travel to Sandakan.

Then there was Marilyn from Paris, who mentioned she had been traveling in China for several months. We also had two Chinese boys in the room who were quite humorous. One of them had a nickname back home: “Spinach” (Bo Cai). Since neither Marilyn nor I knew the word for this specific vegetable in English, we struggled to explain it. Finally, in a moment of linguistic improvisation, we told Marilyn his name was simply “Vegetable.” To our amusement, the nickname stuck.

The next morning, while I was enjoying breakfast, “Vegetable” approached me and invited me to join their group tour to a nearby island. I was thrilled to accept, especially when I learned that Marilyn had been invited as well. It seemed my lonely journey was about to become a shared adventure.

### PULAU SAPI

The destination was an island named Sapi. To our Chinese ears, the name sounded suspiciously like "shǎ bī" (stupid), so we jokingly refused to call it by its real name. Instead, we rechristened it "Mermaid Island," a title that proved to be far more than just a joke.

We spent the afternoon snorkeling in the shallow waters. Although the seabed was littered with patches of dead coral, the crystal-clear water created a mesmerizing stage. It was there that I witnessed the origin of Marilyn’s nickname. As she dove beneath the surface, her movements were incredibly fluid and graceful. Through my camera lens, I captured a stunning shot of her gliding silently among the fish, her silhouette framed by the shimmering sunlight filtering from above. She looked exactly like a real-life mermaid. It wasn’t a trick of the light or an overactive imagination; the resemblance was uncanny. From that moment on, "Mermaid" wasn’t just a playful tease—it was her definitive title among us.

After lunch, a divergence of opinions arose regarding our next activity. Marilyn was eager to try parasailing, dreaming of soaring high above the turquoise sea. However, "Vegetable" hesitated, deeming the activity too expensive and opting out. Seeing this as a unique opportunity to share the sky with our "Mermaid"—and perhaps to capture another magical moment—I immediately agreed to join her, leaving Vegetable to enjoy the beach below.

The adventure, however, came with a steep price. Upon returning from the island, I discovered that my back had been severely sunburned. The pain was immediate and intense. Over the next few days, large patches of skin began to peel off, a painful but vivid reminder of my day under the tropical sun.

### THE BLACK GUY

Originally, my itinerary was fixed well in advance; I had purchased all flight tickets early, allocating only a few days for a stopover in Kota Kinabalu. However, upon discovering the pristine diving spots in Semporna, I felt compelled to incorporate this destination into my tight schedule. This adjustment inevitably fragmented my time in Kota Kinabalu, forcing me to cut my stay short. Consequently, the following day, I had to reluctantly forgo further underwater exploration and embark on the next leg of my journey.

<a-flight flight="AK6262" departure="BKI" destination="TWU" departure-time="2014-01-08 16:05" arrive-time="2014-01-08 17:00"></a-flight>

While waiting in the airport lounge, I encountered a Black man who claimed to have a special affinity for Chinese people, citing a previous visit to Guangdong. With feigned earnestness, he boasted about how adored he was by the local girls, going so far as to claim that virgins threw themselves at him.

Although he seemed to derive great pleasure from recounting these tales, I found his company increasingly tedious.

As boarding commenced, he mentioned his seat was in Row 28 and inquired about mine, clearly hoping to continue our conversation on the plane. With a subtle hint of smugness, I informed him that I was seated in Row 6, within the premium cabin. Thus, while he proceeded toward the rear door, I boarded through the front. In doing so, I ensured that I would never see him again.

## SEMPORNA

<a-times :times="1" location="SEMPORNA"></a-times>

Prior to the trip, aware that hailing a taxi in Semporna is notoriously difficult, I had arranged online to share a ride from the airport with a fellow traveler. However, upon landing, I encountered an immediate predicament: my phone battery had died. I stepped outside the terminal to find a shop selling phone cards so I could recharge and contact my partner.

While I was there, a local driver approached me, asking if I was the passenger he had been sent to pick up. Since my phone was off, I did not know my partner's name, nor could I confirm if this was the correct vehicle. Hesitant and unsure, I declined the offer. As I would later discover, it was indeed the right car, and my partner was furious at my no-show.

Shortly after, a rude Brazilian man arrived to buy a phone card. Seizing the opportunity, I asked if I could join his ride. Initially reluctant, he eventually agreed, provided the driver consented. After confirming with the driver that we shared the same destination, I boarded the minibus, agreeing to cover my share of the transportation fare.

Upon checking into our accommodation—a modest dive lodge—we discovered to our surprise that we had been assigned to the same room. Also staying there were Feng Cheche, the very partner I had missed at the airport, and another girl who had just signed up for scuba diving lessons. Once we began talking, Feng Cheche and I realized we had both planned to travel to Penang in a few days.

However, the atmosphere was tense. The Brazilian man was extremely abrasive, declaring that he refused to let anyone sleep on the top bunk of the double bed. Unwilling to argue, I relocated for the night to an empty dormitory room next door.

My itinerary allowed for only a single night in Semporna. The following morning, as I prepared to depart, the Brazilian man approached me. We shared a brief hug, and he offered a sincere apology for his behavior the previous night. With that matter resolved, I boarded Uncle Chang's boat.

### PULAU MABUL


```<a-img>

Before boarding the boat, I coincidentally met a fellow traveler from Chengdu while Uncle Chang, the proprietor of the local dive shop, was driving him to the bank. Once on board, I noticed three girls speaking Cantonese. Initially assuming they were from Hong Kong, I politely inquired and learned they were actually from Guangzhou. One introduced herself as Butterfly; another wore a distinctive outfit adorned with a tomato pattern, which prompted me to affectionately nickname her "Tomato Soup."


<a-hotel name="Uncle Chang Bungalow" date="2014-01-09" nights="2" points="118.6271726,4.2477133"></a-hotel>

At our accommodation, we shared a room with a diver from Taiwan. He enthusiastically recounted his underwater experiences, telling me that just days prior, he had spotted several sea turtles right beneath this very platform. He confidently assured me that with a keen eye, I would surely encounter them as well. Motivated by his words, I spent considerable time on the platform over the following days, eagerly scanning the waters. Regrettably, not a single turtle appeared.

On one occasion, anxiety spread among the platform staff when a diving boat failed to return on schedule. When it finally docked safely, the Taiwanese diver revealed that the team had encountered a perilous "washing machine current" near Sipadan, which had nearly jeopardized their safe return. Witnessing such dramatic incidents—where danger and wonder coexisted—profoundly impacted me. It was these very experiences that ultimately inspired me to embark on my own journey into the world of diving.

Additionally, we encountered a girl from Chongqing diving alongside her mother on the platform, a sight that filled us all with admiration for her courage.

### KAPALAI

The three girls from Guangdong had planned only a brief half-day stopover; their itinerary involved snorkeling at Kapalai before proceeding to Mataking Island. Our boat ferried them towards Kapalai, taking a route that passed the Seaventure Dive Rig—a distinctive offshore oil platform repurposed into a diving resort. We paused beneath the towering structure to drop off a fellow passenger, a girl who was scheduled to stay there.

```<a-img>
name:girl2rig
```

As I gazed up at the rig, I couldn't help but wonder how intriguing it must be to live and dive from such a unique platform.

```<a-img>
name:mabul-2
```

Upon arriving at Kapalai, a resort renowned for its crystalline waters and stilted villas, we immediately donned our snorkeling gear. The three girls from Guangdong and I ventured further out than the rest, swimming until we reached the most distant water villa on the edge of the reef. The scenery was breathtaking, but our isolation soon became a concern.

<a-gallery :img="[{name:'kapalai-1'},{name:'kapalai-2'},{name:'kapalai-3'}]"></a-gallery>

Suddenly, urgent shouts from the crew pierced the air, signaling all snorkelers to return to the boat immediately. I scanned the surface and realized Butterfly was the furthest away, struggling against a strengthening current. Without hesitation, I swam to her side, grasped her hand firmly, and rolled onto my back. Adopting a steady backstroke, I began to pull us both towards the boat.

It was a wondrous and intimate sensation. As I stroked upward with rhythmic effort, keeping us afloat, Butterfly clung to my hand, her gaze fixed downward like a timid child mesmerized by the ocean floor below. In that moment, with the vast sea surrounding us and our hands tightly linked, a subtle, unspoken current of affection flowed between us. Although we parted ways shortly after, the existence of this ambiguous connection was indeed confirmed during our conversations several months later.


### PULAU MABUL

A favorite pastime on the platform involved a simple yet challenging game: swinging a small iron ring suspended from a string to hook it onto a stationary metal peg positioned opposite. It was an addictive diversion that initially frustrated most players, as the ring would stubbornly swing back and forth, eluding capture time and again. I spent a solid hour mastering it before finally discerning the trick: one must guide the ring in an elliptical trajectory and apply a subtle spinning force, which stabilizes its path and allows it to latch onto the hook with satisfying precision.

The weather in January, however, was notoriously inclement. One day, the sky turned a bruised purple under heavy overcast clouds, and fierce winds whipped across the deck. Rumors spread that a typhoon was brewing in the Philippines, sending shivers of anticipation through the resort.

Seeking shelter from the gale, a group of local Bajau Laut, often referred to as "sea nomads," gathered on the platform. Among them were several young men with sun-bronzed skin and radiant smiles. One of them strummed a guitar, filling the windy afternoon with melodious songs that warmed our hearts. In a spontaneous moment of camaraderie, a group of Malay tourists, who had appeared as if out of nowhere, approached me to request a photo. Though they were complete strangers, they explained warmly that they were from Penang—just not the George Town district I was destined to visit soon. Their unexpected friendliness served as a bright spot amidst the gloomy weather, reminding me of the genuine hospitality found in these remote corners of the world.

After my initial group of friends had dispersed, I found myself in the company of two new companions. Although I never learned their names nor exchanged contact details, I distinctly remember them being from Shanghai. As the island gradually emptied out, we bonded and spent a considerable amount of time together.

```<a-img>
name:mabul-8.jpg
dir:privacy
```

I spent most of my time with the taller girl, who had long flowing hair. Our days were filled with simple discoveries; once, we delighted in observing a hermit crab scuttling across the platform. On another occasion, we ventured onto the nearby inhabited island, where we encountered indigenous locals and observed stationed military personnel. However, our exploration made us lose track of time. Upon returning, we were greeted with panic: the snorkeling boat had already set sail without us. With no other option, we resigned ourselves to waiting for the next scheduled trip, sharing a laugh over our carelessness.

The girl with short hair left two vivid impressions on me. The first was the striking image of her in a white bikini while snorkeling, exuding confidence amidst the blue waters. The second was the noticeable attention she received from the dive shop staff; several of them were clearly taken with her and frequently inquired about her identity.

Coincidentally, our journeys off the island aligned. We shared the same transfer vehicle provided by the dive shop, though our paths diverged upon arrival in Tawau. They headed to the airport for their flights, while I proceeded to the town center. It was a typical transient travel friendship—intense while it lasted, yet ending as quietly as it began.

Upon my return to Kota Kinabalu, the room was empty. As evening approached, I ran into Marilyn coming back, and we made plans to have dinner together. After our meal, she suggested going to a nearby spot for a couple of drinks.

### SALT DOG

I followed her to an open-air bar. We talked about some things, such as her experience in China and why she wanted to go back to France. She recommended a wine that was soaked in salt, and she was surprised that I finished it so quickly and ordered another one. Afterwards, we walked back to the hostel along the road. When I entered the room, she was video chatting with her boyfriend on the bed, and I said hello.

The next morning, I was bored flipping through my book when he came over and squatted at my feet, telling me that she was going to KK Mountain with another tourist here. So, we parted ways. It was a strange feeling. I also wanted to go up the mountain with her, but my itinerary was already set.

Thus, in the hostel, I was once again left with only a cat for company. This cat enjoyed gazing out from the balcony much like the idle me.

When I got back to the room, a young girl was sitting on the upper bed and waving to me. She was named Isis, from Hongkong.

I introduced her to the Cheche, and together we headed off to Little India.

### DANNI

We strolled leisurely along the coastline.
Fengcheche have been astonished, "What a cute self photography girl. Let me help you."
It turned out that there was a girl taking selfies nearby. After striking up a conversation, we discovered that she hailed from Chongqing.

When we asked her which hostel she was staying at, she couldn't quite remember the name but knew it was on Love Lane. As it happened, we were heading in the same direction and decided to walk together. There was a chance that, quite coincidentally, we might even be staying at the same hostel.

Upon arrival, wouldn't you know it, this turned out to be the exact hostel where Isis and I were staying! It was an amusing thought – what if we were actually in the same room? Such serendipitous occurrences do happen in the world.

### NIGHT MARKET

In the evening, we made plans to explore the night market together in search of a delicious meal.

```

To reach the bustling night market, we meandered through a few lively streets, and every step proved worthwhile. Our first gastronomic adventure involved sampling the Four-Fruit Soup, which was simply delightful; its unique flavor was so captivating that we couldn't resist having it multiple times throughout the evening. The soy sauce chicken feet were equally remarkable, leaving us in awe of their succulent texture and rich taste.

Danni and I also shared an incredibly luscious durian, one whose unparalleled sweetness and creamy goodness has been etched in my memory, making it a benchmark that I've yet to encounter again elsewhere. As the night progressed, Danni and I returned to the market for some scrumptious takeout – a serving of fried rice noodles that perfectly capped off our unforgettable culinary escapade at the night market.

### BAR

Afterwards, we excitedly suggested visiting a local bar for some more fun.

Before arriving, I had heard about Penang's safety situation. Although the girls were not carrying backpacks, on our way back, I deliberately made sure they stayed closer to the inside of the sidewalk. It was at this moment that a motorcycle zoomed past me, with two people aboard; the passenger in the backseat gave me a peculiar look. "Could this be one of those snatch-and-grab incidents?" I thought to myself.

Right after my concern, a police motorcycle cruised by my side, also manned by two officers. The rear rider, a policeman, was eyeing me as well, seemingly assessing if I was in any kind of danger or had just encountered one. This juxtaposition underscored the city's vigilance against potential threats while also highlighting my own awareness and caution in navigating the streets of Penang.

We all agreed that the previous incident was a potentially dangerous encounter.

### BEACH

The next day, Isis went Langkawi.

The rest of us took buses along the coast, heading to a public beach. The coastline was truly beautiful, but I don't remember anything particularly special about it. In fact, I've even doubted whether this event really happened or if we simply walked around and left.

When we first arrived at the mountain, it seemed as though we could hear monkeys calling. However, after walking deep into the mountains without seeing a single one, we thought that the monkeys wouldn't show themselves. After walking for a while longer, a small shop appeared by the roadside, and I bought an ice cream cone to eat as I walked. Suddenly, I noticed a monkey on the path ahead, staring at me with angry eyes, as if wanting to snatch my cone. Soon, I spotted two smaller monkeys by the side of the road as well. In the end, I shared some of my ice cream with them.

As it got dark quickly, we descended the mountain. At the foot of the mountain, at a junction, we ate at a street stall. Around six o'clock, the owner suddenly started packing up. In China, six o'clock is when night markets are just starting to open. We all said that maybe Malaysians value life more than making money.

The next day, she departed for Kota Kinabalu.

### GERGORE TOWN

I had intended to extend my stay at the hostel for another two days, but the owner informed me that the upcoming weekend was a holiday and all rooms were fully booked. Consequently, I had no choice but to find alternative accommodations. Later on, Isis returned from Langkawi, but unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to meet up.

## KUALA LUMPUR

I traveled back to Kuala Lumpur from Penang by bus and checked into a hostel on Jalan Alor. To my surprise, there were only two other foreign travelers at the hostel who were discussing where they could find accommodations that were five dollars cheaper. The following day, true to their word, they actually moved out to another place. Consequently, I found myself as the sole guest in the hostel.

Subsequently, I spent my time wandering around Kuala Lumpur and engaging in some mundane activities.
