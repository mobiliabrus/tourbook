On the forum, I posted a thread detailing my trip to Chiang Mai, and unexpectedly, this led to connecting with fellow travelers. Some of these newfound acquaintances even ended up crossing paths with me during my journey. Some of them were important.

Sheyao had originally planned to come with us to Koh Tao to learn diving, but had to change her itinerary due to a friend visiting Chiang Mai.

Qin and me met up on Khao San Road and went for a massage. After that, we were waiting for the bus.

We sat in the first row on the second floor, and I even brought beer onto the bus; they don't usually allow eating or drinking on the bus. Later, when I was sleeping, the beer spilled, leaving the bus smelling of alcohol.

The vehicle stopped at a midway station, and after an agonizing night, we finally arrived in Chumphon just before dawn.

It's still the rainy season. As we were boarding the boat under the steel canopy at the pier, a large dark cloud drifted over. I only heard the sound of thunder rolling from a distance, approaching quickly and then fading away swiftly. This is typical of the coastal climate.

## KOH TAO

We eventually got on the boat, and the sea was very rough; it felt like we were surfing as the boat rose and fell with the waves, dropping suddenly each time. Half of the passengers on board ended up seasick and vomiting. I couldn’t vomit though, which left me feeling miserable with nausea. Qin, however, was fine. I only felt better after forcing myself to sleep for a while; when I woke up, we could already see Koh Tao.

### CRYSTAL DIVE

When we first arrived on the island, it would often rain, and the ground was crawling with millipedes as thick as thumbs. The diving shop provided free accommodation, but Qin wasn’t satisfied with it and rented another room elsewhere. I, on the other hand, made do with what was provided.

Once the classes started, the weather gradually cleared up, and it didn’t rain after that.

There was a girl among the trainees who I found very agreeable, so I asked her out for dinner. However, she already had plans with another guy, so the three of us went together. We went to an Italian restaurant where I ordered pizza and an additional dish to share with everyone. But this turned out to be unnecessary; in their culture, they don’t share food and didn’t partake in it. Their conversation mostly revolved around European landmarks they had visited, which left me unable to contribute much to the discussion.

Later, when Qin finished her course, I took the opportunity to leave as well.

### MOONDANCE

I had originally planned to go to this cliff house with her, but now I have to muster the courage to go alone. Qin was also left behind.

_The room is in darkness. Moonlight penetrates the threadbare curtain. The bed is surrounded by a mosquito net._

_Just visible through the net is the outline of two human forms entwined._

_#THE BEACH#_

The house stood perched atop a cliff, facing the vast expanse of the ocean. Constructed from bamboo, it consisted of a single room and a spacious veranda, with walls woven from the same material that allowed glimpses of the outside world through its many gaps. Inside, there was a large bed, draped in mosquito netting, reminiscent of the one depicted in the film "The Beach."

Behind the house stretched a large courtyard enclosed by stone walls, featuring a washbasin and an open-air toilet.

The only difference between this setting and the movie was my solitude and lack of purpose.

In the dead of night, I was awakened by sounds emanating from the courtyard. Switching on the light, I discovered a group of large crabs scuttling about.

In retrospect, I wonder what compelled me to traverse half of Koh Tao, from one beach on one side of the mountain to another shore on the opposite side. Even with the risk of getting lost in the dark, I had to seek assistance from a local shopkeeper. They sent a motorcycle to fetch me, yet the steep downhill descent filled me with such trepidation that I chose to walk instead. Upon reaching my destination, I discovered that the hotel provided transportation services. So, what was the purpose of this arduous journey? Was it for the sake of a breathtaking vista or the hope that some goddess might suddenly appear amidst these surroundings?
