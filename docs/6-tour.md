Why you visit a place twice, people asked. First, it provides me chance to compensate. Then, I have memories there.

## KOH SIMILAN 2

Manta Queen 1 - Khao Lak - Phuket bus terminal 2, by Scuba Adventures' mini bus.
Bus terminal - Krabi, by bus to Hat Yai, walked to Krabi town at 2 a.m.
Awaked at 5 a.m, Lomprayah's bus terminal - Donsak Pier - Koh Phangan Thong Sala Pier - Rin Nai Beach.

### THE GREAT ROUTE

No flight after dive. It's the hardest route plan I've made. 541km, 18 hours, Khao Lak-Phuket-Krabi-Donsak-Koh Phangan, of course no sleep. What do you want?

The most difficult part is Khao Lak-Krabi. The information about the bus between this two destinations is very little. And It seems like I am certainly missing the last bus. After several twists, I found a google image of Pubket Bus Terminal 2, it shows there's a late bus from Phuket to Hat Yai which will stop at Krabi. And the minibus of diver shop also have enough time to transport me to the terminal.

The bus stop at Route 4. I must walk about 4 km to the guesthouse which is across the road of Lomprayah. It was already 2 am when I arrived, and I need wake up at five.

## KOH PHANGAN

I saw flood on this island. The minibus driver had to took detour from the jungle. Arrived at resort after lunchtime, I told the front deck that I had just finished my seagoing tour. The stormy weather made the ship swing and moving up and down. After voyage, I got a week-long Land Sickness which made me feel shifts under my feet.

It is full moon party night.

At midnight, I was so sleepy. I didn't get enough sleep last night, and there's nothing motivates me.

Koh Phangan. Shit. I'm still alone. Every time I woke up, I think I'm going to have passion. When I was home after my first tour, it was worse. I regretted my decisions util I was getting back into the tour.

I'm here a weeknow. Wasting time on binge-watching... Getting softer. Every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker. And every minute I am lonely.

When I was home, I wannted be here. When I was here, all I could think was getting depressed
