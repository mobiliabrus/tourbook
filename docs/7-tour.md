## MOUNT KINABALU

At 2 am, under the stars, the plane departured. In the next four hours, I was half asleep. Since the sun rised up, we arrived at Kula Lumpur. After a time of coffee, I get on the flight down to Kota Kinabalu. When the sun climbed to top, I was riding airport bus. Later, in the terminal of downtown, I found a minibus which will took me to the park. Even sunset, after all the eighteen-hours routes, I've been the foot of KK mountain. I was so tired.

Though a great problem confronted me that I was traveling alone. To climb this mountain, a guide was required. The guide fee is quite expensive, and the best way is share it into six. I need a team, so I made a pickup sign.

### FELLOW TRAVELLERS

The next morning, at the gate, I met three groups. The first one is three pair of Malaysian couples. The second is six Malaysian Chinese from Sepang.
The last is three Malaysian who welcomed me.

The road to Laban Rata is a long long journey. We started at the Timpohon Gate on the 1866m.

I met Ailin and her boyfriend at the restaurant of Laran Rata. She is Chongqinger, and now living in HK. Though I always speak English, She didn't notice that I am Chongqinger too as I told. She felt surprised she can find a fellow countryman here.

I also see the other groups of people in this restaurant. Actully everyone is here, it's just like a home.

I found my passport was wet here, and I filled every page with tissues.

### LOW'S PEAK

_So close, yet so far._

the 4,095.2-meter summit of Low's Peak.

We get up in 3AM. For a snack, we start climb in the dark.
On the half, Ailin and her boyfriend turns back. 

I slipped on a rock and my knees hit, just at the feat of peak.
I imagined that I stood at the peak, no sunrise, saw what I've saught on photos, lonely.
Then I give up. It's necessary to protect my kness as I will go scuba dive days later.

I hit my kness twice again when desend.

## KOTA KINIBALU 3

My kness can not band, extremely pantful pain when walk.
I slowly move to a drug store,

I found a camera in the sand. I asked around, it belongs to nobody. I danced and hang camera over my head. Later, a guy found me, it's his camera. I asked him to check photos in the camera. "Yes, they are!", These must be his important memories.

Middle night, where the music from the beach party is audible, a couple that we should be danced in the party found me. "It's him...a good guy who found a camera..." The guy told her girlfriend. We took photos, and they should uploaded. Unfortunately, I never found it.

After that I took speed boat back to KOH SAMUI.
