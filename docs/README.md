People often questioned my decision to travel alone. For me, it was about seeking new experiences. Traveling alone offered a deeper, more personal connection with the places I visitedâ€”or perhaps, truthfully, it was simply because no one wanted to go with me.

Initially, weary of photographing people, I turned my lens towards landscapes, venturing abroad in search of scenic beauty. However, capturing these picturesque scenes proved challenging, and my trips would stretch over weeks. My photographs showcased the serene beauty around me, devoid of human presence, but soon, the loneliness of returning each night to an empty hotel room began to weigh on me.

In pursuit of companionship and adventure, I embraced backpacking, which opened up opportunities to meet fellow travelers. I yearned for excitement during my travels and hoped for romantic encounters, even dreaming of finding a partner from another country along the way.

Reflecting on my journeys now, I've come to realize that those breathtaking landscape shots hold less significance to me. Instead, it is the spontaneous, candid moments captured on camera that truly resonate. These snapshots taught me that photographs are not just visual records; they carry stories and evoke memories in ways I never anticipated. Through them, I discovered the true essence of travel: it's not merely about the places you visit, but the connections and moments that shape your journey.
