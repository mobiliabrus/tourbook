I've been asked for several times, "Why do you travel alone?" More often than not, I found myself at a loss for a definitive answer. Perhaps being alone allows you more opportunity to absorb your experiences on a personal level, or perhaps, there was no one who wanted to go with me.

I was a dilettante, womanizer, theatrical, egotistical, neurotic person.
