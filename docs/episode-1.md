### South Korea

The year I was crowned Sales Champion, the reward was a trip. However, due to the political unrest associated with the Red Shirt Movement in Thailand, my destination was changed to South Korea. This marked my first journey abroad and my inaugural flight.

Traveling as part of a tour group, we encountered an option to pay extra for a visit to sites along the 38th parallel. Both Wenwen, another traveler in our group, and I decided not to participate. Consequently, we were left at a rest stop while the others continued their excursion. Feeling somewhat desolate, we discovered a nearby convenience store where we bought coffee. Inside, we met the owner's child, who was incredibly charming and eager to play with us. Despite the language barrier, it turned into a delightful encounter. It was a reminder that human connection transcends spoken words.

Upon returning home, I made the pivotal decision to resign from my job and pursue entrepreneurship.

### Weizhou Island

I have visited Weizhou Island twice, first in July 2011.

A friend and I traveled from Chongqing to Nanning by train, then took another train from Nanning to Beihai. From there, we boarded the Feiyu fast ferry to Weizhou Island. Our initial stay was at a place called Piglet Bar, but the rooms were neither comfortable nor affordable. On our first night, we spent several hundred yuan on seafood, enjoying abalone, mantis shrimp, grouper, and, of course, beer.

Later, we moved to a local guesthouse run by the village head. This accommodation was much more reasonable in price, and the fees for seafood processing were also fair. We continued to indulge in our seafood feasts, particularly relishing abalone served with its rich sauce over rice, which could easily fill several bowls. However, we also tried shark meat, an experience that turned out to be truly unpleasant. It had a gritty texture, almost like sand, making it quite unpalatable.

On the Island, we also encountered a female writer whose mature charm captivated me.

After this trip, I resolved to take the plunge and buy my first DSLR camera.
