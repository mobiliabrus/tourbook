### South Korea

The year I was crowned Sales Champion, the reward was a trip. However, due to the Red Shirt Movement outbreak in Thailand, I had to visit South Korea instead. It was my first time traveling abroad and my maiden voyage on an airplane.

I joined a tour group for the journey. When the guide asked if everyone would be willing to pay extra to visit sites along the 38th parallel, Wenwen, a girl in the group, and I opted out. We were left behind at a rest stop along the way, feeling rather pitiful. We stumbled upon a convenience store and went inside to purchase coffee. The owner's child was particularly adorable and approached us to play. Although we couldn't understand each other's words, it was still an enjoyable experience. Language seemed to pose no barrier.

Later on, I resigned from my job and embarked on my entrepreneurial journey.

### Weizhou Island

I've been Weizhou Island twice. The first time is on July 2011.

<a-secret name="zwd" autoload></a-secret>

My friend and I traveled from Chongqing to Nanning by train, and then from Nanning to Beihai by another train. From Beihai, We took the Feiyu fast ferry to Weizhou Island. We first stayed at a place called Piglet Bar, but the rooms were neither good nor cheap. I remember on our first night we spent a few hundred yuan on seafood, including abalone, mantis shrimp, grouper, and of course, beer. Later, we moved to a local guesthouse owned by the village head. The accommodation was affordable, and the seafood processing fees were reasonable. We continued to enjoy our seafood feasts, especially the abalone with its rich sauce poured over rice, which could easily fill several bowls. We even tried shark meat, which was truly horrendous. It had a gritty texture like sand.

The second time I went to Weizhou Island, I went alone.

It was just before this trip that I met her. A high school classmate invited me to dinner, and one of her friends also came along. I was smitten with her at first sight. However, I didn't ask for her contact information then, and perhaps they were wondering why I wasn't more proactive. It wasn't until the next day that I asked my classmate for her QQ number.
