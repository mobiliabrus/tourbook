### South Korea

The year I became a sales champion, the prize was a trip. Due to the outbreak of the Red Shirt Movement in Thailand, I chose to go to South Korea. It was my first time abroad and my first time on a plane.

I joined a tour group. When the tour guide asked if everyone was willing to go to the spots on the 38th parallel at their own expense, a girl named Wenwen and I chose not to go. We were pitifully left at a rest stop on the way. We found a convenience store and went inside to buy coffee to drink. The owner's child was particularly cute, and he came up to play with us. We couldn't understand his words, and he couldn't understand our language, but it was also interesting. Language seemed to be no obstacle.
