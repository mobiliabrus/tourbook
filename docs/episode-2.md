### Weizhou Island

The second time I went to Weizhou Island, I went alone.

### Mount Emei

January, I purchased a complete set of waterproof jackets, packed my camera along with a heavy-duty tripod, and boarded the train bound for Chengdu. Upon disembarking the train, I transferred to a long-distance bus, which eventually delivered me to the foot of Mount Emei. As expected, there were no more vehicles going up the mountain, so I spent the night at the base, and early next morning, I began my ascent.

```

At Leidongping, above which snow had already accumulated, I rested another night. It was then that I realized I'd made a huge mistake—I had forgotten to bring the quick-release plate for my tripod, and there was no replacement available.

Despite this setback, I woke up before dawn the following day and took the cable car to the mountaintop where I stayed the entire day. As darkness fell and snow started again, I had initially planned to camp in a tent; however, it turned out to be nothing more than a makeshift changing room, and with zero camping experience under my belt, I inevitably checked into a hotel instead.

The alarm clock chimed at three o'clock in the morning, and as I stepped outside the hotel, the ground was glazed with a thin layer of ice, unmarked by any footsteps. I found an ideal spot, set up my tripod. Without the quick-release plate, though, my camera couldn't be securely attached to the tripod, so I had to hold it manually throughout the shoot. In the minus double-digit Celsius temperatures of that freezing night, the wind stung my face sharply, and I could only manage somewhat better by positioning myself away from the direction of the wind.

After descending the mountain, I spent another night at its base. From the television there, I watched a news report about the most severe smog weather event in China's history.

### Gulangyu Island

In March, I purchased my very first ticket on a budget airline, scheduled for a flight to Bangkok, Thailand in October. But prior to my trip to Thailand, in June, I spontaneously embarked on a journey to Gulangyu Island—a true embodiment of a "say go and just travel" adventure.

### West Sichua

Having returned from Gulangyu only half a month ago, I received another invitation to travel to West Sichuan. Despite the fact that travelling has indeed become rather frequent lately, I agreed.

My plan is to fly directly to Shangri-La in Zhongdian, then backtrack along National Highway 318,
stopping along the way at Daocheng Yading and eventually reaching Minya Kongka.
